<ul>
<li>
<p>This brings a lot more context to the whole situation, what are your thoughts?!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The youngest son, Michael, watching as the family gathering goes to shit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Starting to seem like fed if amything is a pathological liar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jschlatt didn’t like Katerino, that whole drama happened, He also doesn’t like Fed from the love or host stream, then this happens. Is jschlatt the messiah?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s kinda sad that fed basically cheated her out of several relationships, even if she just wanted to be friends or have dates, this is incredibly controlling, he was just a dick for that, the guy has no right</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was a reason why Temmie always barked at Fed :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Michael Reeves got himself caught in an episode of the Kardashians</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So basically he was just frustrated that poki didn&rsquo;t see him as a potential boyfriend. It&rsquo;s like he wanted the house to be a harem for him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Im tired of hearing the “she didn’t say no” excuse. It’s literally a fight or flight response. People freeze up when their uncomfortable. And if you don’t, then that’s good for you. But not everyone can do that. I’m a pretty confrontational person myself but I have my moments too. My heart goes out to the people that had to go through such a horrible thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I never liked Fed he seemed like he had one of the biggest egos and say stuff like &ldquo;oh im bad at this&rdquo; so others would compliment him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Man, a man I looked up to acting like this. I’m happy I didn’t sub to his twitch again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I actually feel like I was gut punched when I just heard this is true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;i&rsquo;m sorry i&rsquo;m being emotional&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>girl what? there is NOTHING wrong with being emotional.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jealousy is a fools game and shouldn’t be played.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the offline tv archery &ldquo;fed is getting a gf next year&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t very happy anymore</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fed saying yvonne is taking up a spot for content creators in the house, fed hasnt posted in 8 months&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe when that one girl called fed ugly, she wasn&rsquo;t talking about the outside</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>weird I got this in my recommended even though I don&rsquo;t watch Offline TV.

<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s shocking how easily Fed manipulated the situation. This is why everyone should try to figure out both sides of the stories in MOST situations. Open your mouth if you feel uncomfortable about someone because of your experience and try to sort it out because sometimes it CAN be a misunderstanding and sometimes it CAN be the negative feelings you have against someone, ESPECIALLY in friend groups and in business groups. If you don&rsquo;t open your mouth it can lead to certain situations like this one, when the one who doing all this bad shit start manipulating the situation because he/she knows you won&rsquo;t talk or if he/she finds out that you not going to open your mouth they will take advantage of that. Now you can say &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not good for business&rdquo;, &ldquo;you can probably get fired&rdquo;, well if you don&rsquo;t open your mouth then you can have a fed situation when the person ends up manipulating the situation and making you seem bad or crazy THAN you get fired or kick out or open your mouth and take the chance of getting fired/kick out or NOT. Either way its a leap of faith.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am really sorry to hear about all of this, poki always seemed distant from everyone and I guess now we know why, the fact fed forced a wedge in-between poki and the rest of the extended social group is terrible, hopefully in light of recent events they&rsquo;ll be able to form closer friendships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can also understand how bad she must feel, being a confrontational person myself there is nothing worse than finding out you went off on someone for something that isn&rsquo;t true/the whole truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It fits well together that he told others that he is your boyfriend and that he wants to shield you from having other friends. A very fd up pathological way to express &ldquo;love&rdquo; and wanting to be the most important person for somebody. Deep inside he is alone, wants to be accepted and loved, he lacks self-esteem obviously. In my humble opinion he should get professional help. All these sus things he said where definitely a big cry for help. Abusive is what his behaviour was. Wish you, him and all the others all best from the bottom of my heart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to talk about how toast acts “sexist” and “douchey” but he was genuinely concerned for fed and everyone in the house.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Summary : Fed is a manipulative pervert.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I honestly never liked fed&hellip;. To me there was something off about him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I keep waiting for Micheal to just walk in and be like “hey bud” with a taser in hand and then I remember Poki moved out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>now we know why everytime there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;drunk video&rdquo; and fed is involved with it Poki disappears lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn, toast is the literately the coolest guy. Like Yvonne and Lilly trusted him and told him about the events, and then toast straight up confronted him and warned him. He’s a good guy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you know something shady is going on when someone tells you &ldquo;hey this person and I are together&rdquo; followed immediately by &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t talk to anyone about it, ESPECIALLY the other person&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i rlly rlly need to see lily perspective on this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After hearing poki&rsquo;s story I came to the conclusion that fed hasn&rsquo;t mature, things like backbitching and blocking people from dating are things that bad kids/antagonist do in d movies/drama</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i mean i always had a weird feeling when i saw fed just&hellip;&ldquo;simping&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what he did was childish and primal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as a grown man in ac:2020 you should be able to control your desires and toughts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i dont think that its a super power of mine to discard a tought when i feel its might end up bad or hurt someone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>really puts into perspective how much you don&rsquo;t see behind the camera</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Psychopaths are extraordinarily manipulative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quick to read others well, they&rsquo;re always ready to exploit any weaknesses.

<p>They are amazingly charming.</p>
</li>

<p>A psychopath will hurt you, and you&rsquo;ll never see it coming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>brimstone without the &ldquo;brim&rdquo; is just &ldquo;stone.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Literally found out about all this today and this honestly doesn&rsquo;t surprise me. I&rsquo;ve been watching OTV for a while now and Fed&rsquo;s behavior always seemed a little off to me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(I KNEW IT ALL ALONG)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Sociopaths knows others just like them&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Sociopath) People with ASPD may also use “mind games” to control friends, family members, co-workers, and even strangers. They may also be perceived as charismatic or charming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Micheal be like : wtf is going on in this house</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poki didn&rsquo;t make many edits so we saw the raw footage, verbal blunders and all. Despite so, she is quite eloquent at conveying her emotions and thoughts.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>If poki ever sees this, please don&rsquo;t ever be sorry for feeling emotional or feel like you&rsquo;re not explaining things well enough.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am actually an Alcoholic. I am struggling with it every day. There is a misconception that Alcohol kind of &ldquo;releases&rdquo; something or some BS like that, &ldquo;The drunk mind speaks the sober truth&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s BS. I  get black-out drunk almost every night, I have never done ANYTHING this is inconstant with what I believe to be &ldquo;right&rdquo; (especially driving after drunk, not even as a fairly hard-core Alco).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Im really having a hard time getting an overview on this whole thing, cold someone please explain what fed did?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t believe Alex Botez choose him over Schlatt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“This is the biggest Dysfunctional Family I ever seen”</p>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Michael</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>God, I&rsquo;ve experienced awkward and toxic relationships and I can&rsquo;t imagine having to explain it to so many people. This must be tough to deal with. Not your normal viewer but hang in there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lot of People don’t realize the mental toll that it can take on a person when someone that you are so close with and that is in your friend group betrays you and all you feel is resentment towards them.  And you just have to deal with it because they are in your friend group and then you start to second guess yourself and feel guilty because of how much resentment you have towards that person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thinking back on all the odd things I&rsquo;ve seen him done I&rsquo;m really starting to realize that he was messed up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just find it really concerning he did all of this and then had the audacity to smile for the camera like nothing was happening.

<p>Poor Scarra, he just wanted a loving family of streamers in a house, but he&rsquo;s lost all form of control</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i could tell there was a weard look to fed every video he was in so its all coming together now. im sorry for the loss of one of your good friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Summary of the story: Fed is Kira.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When poki said &ldquo;Incidents&rdquo; I was like oh boy, not just one or two?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is gaslighting. Honestly I think Fed is a great creator and a hilarious dude but what he’s done to his friends is outright inconsiderate and manipulative. He pushes boundaries like a shopping cart. Funny thing is, his content has a trend of landing a girlfriend or being in a friend zone. Pitifully ironic where that got him. For real though, hope everyone gets the help they need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rip scarra I feel so bad for him all he wanted was a house of streamers and some good friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I never had a real reason why I didn’t like fed at all but now I do. Just imagine how much time was wasted in a friendship that was conceived to be a great investment just to discover that everything was being manipulated by the same person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2020 is kinda crazy not gonna lie</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well, you can’t spell friend with out end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If fed was removed from the house then it must have been a serious issue, stuff was done, it happened over a long period of time, and enough was enough. Most importantly I hope FED learns from his mistakes and prospers in the future. He is such a great guy from what we know but he messed up big.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suddenly I&rsquo;m not so surprised that he was perpetually single</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Part of me feels sad for fed, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s generally a great guy and person, but this kind of thing needs to be more public nowadays since it happens way too often. I guarantee every single female can say it&rsquo;s happened to her at least once. It&rsquo;s frustrating and demeaning to get taken advantage of like that and it gets swept under the rug because it was &lsquo;in private&rsquo; and women are made to feel like they&rsquo;re over-reacting if they address it. Rape culture needs to end and this is a step in the right direction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you don’t know what fed did to fed n lily&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Honestly, I saw this coming. I started watching offline after Michael came, and I kept noticing some weird things about fed. Something just didn&rsquo;t seem right with him. And I guess I was right</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sounds like he caught feelings and then got played and then got put in the friend zone. I know the feeling. Doesn&rsquo;t justify anything just a sucky feeling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i just started watching offline after michael moved in and i was not expecting this much drama after only a couple of months</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can see she&rsquo;s trying really hard not to cry,I feel so sorry for her</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It kinda sounds like jealousy. They think they&rsquo;re better than Poki, and deserve her fame. Is that why they distance themselves?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As soon as she started talking about lily. I got a add for league of legends whith lily voicing over it lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait so who’s moving now? Fed is kicked out and poki is moving to a girls house? What’s happening with the offline gang now?

<li>
<p>Everyone who Staned Foki must feel pretty weird rn huh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It just seems like fed isn’t taking anything serious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a bright side to this, I&rsquo;m really hoping Yvonne becomes more open and integral as a member of otv. I like Yvonne and would love to see her more often now that he&rsquo;s gone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These people are way to forgiving. He dug his own hole, let him sleep in it. Please do not ever trust him again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fed seems like he has a darker childhood, so problems could arise from that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can tell a lot about a guy when they say they like well done steak with Ketchup.</p>

<p>Holy shit. I have no idea how I didn’t know about this earlier. I knew that there was OTV drama, but I didn’t know it cut this deep. I truly feel so bad for poki, lily, Yvonne, and the rest of OTV. I can’t believe that fed would manipulate people like that. I know that people make bad choices, but this entire psychological manipulation thing is so so fucking malicious. I agree with poki, I honestly still like the good parts of fed and I hope that he can fix all of the problems and somewhat repair the friendships, or at least be able to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always had an off fealing about fed and just a bad feeling every time he&rsquo;s on camera so this doesn&rsquo;t surprise me too much he just seemed like the most likely person in the friend group to do something like this. (Sorry if my writing is all over the place)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fed always seemed like a simping creep sort of individual anyways</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is ironic to see the &ldquo;friendship goals&rdquo; comments again under basically every video.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I remember poki being so depressed because she couldnt make real friends in la&hellip; all along her &ldquo;best&rdquo; friend was absolutely screwing her over. that sucks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I never liked fed. He always seemed like a simp and a weirdo that was going through a constant identity crisis. He absolutely wreaked of weakness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So what we learned from this statement&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>I love Toast</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really hate that this is who he turned out to be, he was my favorite person in the house.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can feel the &ldquo;Moroccan-ness&rdquo; is still prevalent in the way she talks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now I can see why jschlatt didn’t like fed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To Poki: Thank you for sharing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To Brimstone: Thank you for sharing/uploading.

<li>
<p>I feel you, I&rsquo;ve been in very bad friendships too and it really hurts, HUGE HUGS to y&rsquo;all ! &lt;3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you realise you&rsquo;ve been watching for 30 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This might seem like a joke but was myth the guy at the house party that fed kept poki away from??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the whole &ldquo;Asian kink&rdquo; thing feels so much grosser now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He may not be a sociopath, but he has several sociopathic tendencies.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>The majority of those who knew him considered Fed to be their close friend. A standard trait of a sociopath is that they are charming and gregarious people. They know exactly what to say to everyone to get them to like them. That&rsquo;s probably why you were drawn to them in the first place. The amount of people defending this sexual assaulter shows how likable he appeared to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like this whole situation is a good example why especially within friend groups communication about that stuff is important if shady stuff is happening or you are uncomfortable around a member it should be talked about</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bro everything makes so much sense like it was like a puzzle with only the outside pieces and now we have the whole puzzle, I never liked feds vibe when I started watching offline tv and this definitely makes it worse but all around no hate just angered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Drama with fed”. Oh boy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plot twist: fed never left but is stuck in the basement with Micheal. Doomed to eternal torture</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Next micheal video: hey guys I made this cyborg!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dam poki mad. Becus this video ain’t making money so she can’t benefit from copy striking this vid😂😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching Feds mental/psychological state change for awhile.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>This is also why I&rsquo;m not close to many people. I&rsquo;m only close to people who I 100% trust. It can take years to gain my trust and if you aren&rsquo;t one of my close 3 you can lose my trust in an instant. I don&rsquo;t like to chance these things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I mean&hellip; Fed shit talked Evonne on camera and we thought it was part of their humor sooo&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are there so many victim shamers in the comment section? It&rsquo;s not as easy as saying &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Please put yourselves in their point of view,,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought his quarrels with Yvonne were always memey amd part of their personas but I guess there was a very real component in there

</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never watched poki, but she seems like a literal good person. Stay blessed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bro&hellip; I know this is important but my eye was drawn to that open door the whole time. Like, who put those hinges all in the middle. Kinda odd looking to me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just to clarify, isolating a girl/woman (in this case Poki) from her friend/support group, and inserting yourself as the main point of contact in between, and manipulating the way people see your relationship and her as a person is TEXTBOOK abusive behaviour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that the one guy clued her in on what he was saying behind her back, and the fact that she&rsquo;s super confrontational may be the thing that saved her from also having a &ldquo;Yvonne/Lily incident&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lmao fed sounds like my uncle dude has no respect for women</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More or less when she said “I hate how the one person who I told I wanted to have these relationships so badly was the one who prevented years of possible friendships” hit different 😢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is some fresh drama here Lady&rsquo;s and gentle men.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Michael should really make his own Slo Mo esque type show</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel as if Michael has lead the true new era of offlinetv getting skeletons out of their closet</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Probably didn&rsquo;t word this right</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For some reason&lt; &ldquo;help pain a prettier pictures,&rdquo; just sounds like deceit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fed needs a therapist and to start talking about his issues and address his elephant in the room. Guy definitely has some behavioral issues he cant control. Avoiding his own blindspots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was so happy when that piece of hair finally dropped.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NEVER apologize for telling the truth.  It&rsquo;s his problem that has impacted your entire personal and online communities.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Also, it&rsquo;s okay to not want to be near or around him.  You don&rsquo;t HAVE to be part of his recovery.  THIS IS ON HIM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh, I thought he told T Pain &ldquo;Me and Poki are kind of a thing.&rdquo; as a joke, quess not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dude get on DR K about this, (privately if possible). Guys an emotional abuser wether he realises or not and it will help to get support with that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crazy how fed ended up being removed for reasons worse than Albert

<li>
<p>If they were scared of how fed would of acted with power over a girl that’s one giant problem, I understood he might maker her uncomfortable, but if you were worried about sexual than just a bad deal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holy shit I had the same kind of experience, I totally understand what she went through, it still gives me « trust issues » where sometimes I will doubt if my friend are genuine with me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Her body language just tells me that she is telling the truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>-using hand gestures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>-has a clam and non shakey tone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>-and they all have the same problem some worse than others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wafflezz bj XD I was holding my phone to my ear to listen since my headphones are at home and im in public those first 2 words My ear typed by accident XD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wait so THATS why poki wasnt around in a lot of the &ldquo;collabs&rdquo; where the streamers were like hanging out?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perfect example of: Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Im not an emotional person in the leaast, but ive never felt so much anger and sadness to something I relate so hard to, well my Mother has been cut off from her friends this exact way by my dumbass father, its heartbreaking to see and I cant say that I wish Fed the best.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>its sad that he had a lot of friends that they assumed him as a best friend like poki and moe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Call me a simp, and call her a twitch thot all you want, she is handling this in such a good way. You can tell she is trying her best to keep shit positive even in the hard times which is hard to do with what happened with her. Ggs poki and good luck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whelp, who had “Influencers with hidden shit motives” for July?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn, I started watching offline tv when Michael Reeves joined, and I was slowly getting to like Fed but it’s quite sad that Fed wasn’t able to keep boundaries after lots of chances. I never would have guessed he was the manipulative one!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I seriously think that he’s a good manipulator, on camera, he molds his personality to fit online and likable, while off camera, he’s very manipulative and he seems like he’s a bit of an asshole off camera according to this video</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and he I was thinking if I lived with Fed we would be a good bros, that talking shit behind back and pushing them to hate someone who think he&rsquo;s your friend is really shitty,  like deep down I knew that the girls had something not to like (more than a friend) Fed, since in my eyes (as a straight dude) seems like a handsome and good dude (on Camera) but Gosh I never imagined it was something like this. also when he used to say that Yvon does nothing, in front of Camera, or when in a video they voted her as someone who hangs out with her friends and go see them the most in a podcast, he said that&rsquo;s her job it doesn&rsquo;t count, and they agreed with him after, I thought he was joking when he says things like that; also, since I thought Poki and Fed were good friends, since ther&rsquo;s so much vids about them, and her mom liking him and inviting him to visit considering him as her son, I thought like damn these guys are really close, but Boy I was wrong, also I do that ignore people&rsquo;s existence thing it&rsquo;s really effective but, I only do it when people wrong me, if you use it elsewhere that&rsquo;s an asshole move, but it&rsquo;s really good to use when people don&rsquo;t know your worth,  also I thought of Fed and Yvon relationship always him annoying her, and she replies by cursing him as a content move like Tom and Jerry thing even if it was intentional but I can see how she could be annoyed, and this is why I don&rsquo;t drink. Keep it Halal Guys</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Okay this is wild. You just said he lied to multiple guys that you were dating just so he could keep you to himself. Then not too long after saying the situation must have not felt good for him either. He is doing some manipulative shady af things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn imagine wanting to make friends/relationships with other people but you have that one <code>friend</code> spreading false information about you to prevent you. That&rsquo;s so disheartening to learn that your trust was misplaced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We were in the perfect arc, the Albert situation had been digested, Michael was there for lily, everything was fine. It had to blow up in their faces hadn&rsquo;t it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I never saw any completed clear signs that Fed was acting in this way, however the Lyon down in other’s beds on stream and highlights often featured in the OTV channels made them look bad for a while now.

<li>
<p>i swear i was wandering what would happen if someone got kicked out just the other day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I knew he was kinda shitty since lily and albert situation cause he just started the unwanted drama for lily which led her to crying on stream and also his attitude</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite all the things happening i still cant stand her lol&hellip;i justdont know why. She just gives me a strange vibe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>toast is a goddamn wizard he knows everything</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yvonne does nothing but play league. So seems like shes living her best life to me :D</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your reaction/emotions is perfectly normal prior to the things happened Poki, Thankyou for your courage addressing/informing us from your personal experiences with fed. Try not to stress about it, it already happened and it&rsquo;s getting handled, Wishing you guys all the best especially for recovery! Moree Love!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine disliking the video just because you agree with Fed&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Micheal reeves scarra ve lily should get outta there and move out lol</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>(I don&rsquo;t watch toast so I dunno much about him)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>kicking him out of the house wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;over-the-top.&rdquo; fed was warned and still didn&rsquo;t bother to fix his drinking problem until they actually pushed him to leave. plus, it&rsquo;ll only create more trouble and uncomfortableness if he stayed. it was bound to happen, especially if he never listened to warnings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imma be straight honest&hellip;.Schlatt should have won that Austin Show</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every time I watch a new channel drama happens about a week later, first Danplan now this .-.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna think fed is a bad guy bc he so funny and I really love his steams and his community. I don&rsquo;t wanna take sides bc I love otv I love fed Micheal Lilly pokimaine scaara Yvonne toast. I just wish I can help in anyway to keep otv together. But sadly that&rsquo;s currently impossible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Long story short he got friendzoned by poki and he tried to get out the friend zone by any means no matter what it took, and it took everything&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>damn she must&rsquo;ve felt so lonely with how everyone thought she was batshit crazy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when I rewatch otv I can&rsquo;t look at the fanart on the walls with fed with everyone else without getting a weird feeling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like how Micheal reeves just watches from the background and he isn&rsquo;t mentioned</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sociopaths aren&rsquo;t really people you can fix and &ldquo;quiting alcohol &quot; won&rsquo;t fix that. Its better to stear clear of of those people, otherwise your just asking for trouble in your life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here I thought Fed was the player of the house. Really he was the incel. Got it.

<li>
<p>You know that stereotype how boys and girls cant be friends. That&rsquo;s fed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does everyone fall for this?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obviously Fed was offerd a contract by Netflix.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;YOU Season 2&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<li>
<p>Poki: I am not perfect</p>

<li>
<p>The Simps: I&rsquo;m just gonna pretend like I didn&rsquo;t hear that&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m sry but I started laughing when she did the &lsquo;sigh&rsquo; at the start</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jschlatts gonna be happy about this one</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Chaos is a ladder&rdquo; - Fed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By the time they&rsquo;ve  done with all 3rd drama it&rsquo;s gonna be a entire new cast with just poki left for the views and scarra since he organized it I feel like OTV wasn&rsquo;t meant to be as they often explode into dramas that they&rsquo;ve bottled up not a gradual push and pull created by a video or action done by them.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean any offense to them but most content houses are racking in numbers 30x what OTV views get in a month like the Sidemen they can 24M per video while only having 8M  subs that is a big number, but even before then they got good amounts of views and of the same caliber as well, OTV they don&rsquo;t excel the content its just basic or interesting while the Sidemen do videos like Sidemen tinder , blind dating, who gained the most weight  and roasting all great funny ideas that you can steal or twist but you don&rsquo;t you do boring uninteresting ideas some are good like the DM video but others are just ahem as the french would say la merde et la connerie</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I always felt like fed was so weird inside offline tv like he looks/acts like a frat boy just being impulsive and extra, while the rest might be weird but look more calm/having fun with each other. Idk I feel drama is going to constantly happen in a place where you live with your coworkers that are also your friends and unless everyone develops an extreme friendship offlinetv is someday gonna fall apart and everyone is just going to live in their own place even if they still work together</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel for poki man ik fed screwed up everyones head but if they where really friends im sure they’d know how she acc is i dnt get it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I always thought it was weird how he was just literally lying in peoples beds&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine throwing away such a great friendgroup&rsquo;s trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I saw this coming miiiiiiiiiiiiles away lol. I said to my friend over a year ago when watching a stream of him interacting with Poki that he was creepy AF. 0 game lonely and manipulative. Well, here we are 🤷‍♂️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That’s so funny because I’ve never watched poki’s streams but I’ve seen Fed (who I also didn’t know) in her videos and her room and always assumed they were dating</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn, sometimes picking the right venting partner is hard and takes time&hellip;

<p>This just goes to show that we dont really &ldquo;know&rdquo; these streamers/ youtubers etc. We only know their online personas but off camera they can be almost like a different person and this just goes to show that we shouldnt say things like we &ldquo;know&rdquo; them because the truth is we really dont :/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Dont attack people”&hellip;gets someones sponsors taken away</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn, upon my initial look at the situation I was somewhat supporting Fed because I hadn&rsquo;t heard of all this behind the scenes stuff, all I knew was what was in the Yvonne twitter log thing. My thought process was that, as a dude, he was &ldquo;checking the limits&rdquo; (most dudes will understand what that means) with his close female friends and there wasn&rsquo;t any negative response towards him whilst doing so. He was told what happened on multiple occasions but he was never told that any of those actions were not okay; in a sense I believed he was lead on and then fucked over for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bruh.. fed was gone dude, he’s was j too decimated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh, so this is why Fed doesn&rsquo;t get any girls</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I guess this just goes to prove how we as viewers really have no clue as to what goes on behind the scenes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its funny how when Dr. K says that there&rsquo;s someone who have a mental problem and should be avoided inside the offlinetv and some people thought he was talking about poki but then it turns out to be fed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>damn i&rsquo;ve never tought there is some one this baad</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No shocker here. No way you can keep a guy friend looking like that😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fedmyster is a pervert, he wants all the girls in otv. if he can&rsquo;t get it he will destroy it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s crazy to think now that she kind of missed a bit out on life at her age because of the guy. Like lost friendships and relationships. Kinda makes sense how she’s moving in with a group of girls she gets along with and maybe live a little.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has anyone else felt that Fed seem&rsquo;d so out of the line to the rest of otv house? He is so shy and doesn&rsquo;t have the same energy like the rest of them there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He was flirting with poki in so many times. Thought pokimane was too naive to realize it. But this explains all</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this goes to show how important it is to hear the other person&rsquo;s side of the story. I&rsquo;m learning more and more now that no matter how much you trust one person, that isn&rsquo;t the only person you should listen to. really sad that the girls had gone through all this on their own, doubting each other and being manipulated. I really hope that their relationships can be better now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remembering that poki got him a huge ass FED sign with pictures of them makes this even more sad :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lili as in LilyPichu? Dayum i love lily&rsquo;s streams and Pokimanes. Yall 100% some of my top 10 streamers to watch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That cycle Poki was describing of her being really close to him then something would happen and she wouldn’t trust him, then she was close again&hellip; Is literally a textbook description of and abusive relationship. The cycle and distancing her from her friends and making her only trust him&hellip; you could not make up a better example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>everyone just going to ignore that her hair is floating?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;i really dont want to do this&rdquo; makes excuse using her period then proceeds to do this for 20 minutes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Something similar happened to me when I broke up with my best friend. A guy I knew asked me if me and x person were still in a relationship I told him it’s none of his business. Later on he asked x person if we were dating after she said why he told her that I said we were. I told her that he was lying I’m not sure if she believed me.

<p>Have to respect Poki here, of course we don&rsquo;t know all the details but she seems genuine and humble whilst still maintaining composure and being fair towards everyone. Golden</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought Fed editing Poki&rsquo;s videos. Does she edit them herself?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think Fed, judging by the events, just took things way to far. But still I don&rsquo;t want to be one to judge.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Maybe Fed had some relationship and rejection issues so he grew more desperate, or he wanted cloud from a relationship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this feels like textbook emotional abuse, especially with the way they are still so sympathetic of him and this behaviour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know this word is mentioned a lot these days but it feels like a narcissistic pervert behavior</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and remember how she told that one time she cleaned Feds&rsquo;s pee, when he peed on a chair and took care of him when he was super drunk, yooooo</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes boys are jealous even if he has no relationship with the girl</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just for perspective, what exactly happened between lilly/Yvonne and fed, I&rsquo;m really behind on the situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poki: mind you</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>-EBZ enters the chat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really liked Fed as a person, I thought he was very nice, and he genuinely helped out a lot of people, but this just sheds light on how manipulative he is, and I genuinely hope he seeks help for his issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>damn.. fking fed.. i hopped on his stream once before and never felt a good vibe from him ever. The ONLY reason i actually dont watch offlinetv content anymore as time went on, was seeing feds actions that even made ME feel uncomfortable through the screen. this was all for the better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn he got friend zoned so hard that he went straight up creep

<p>Take this year, you can have it back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This fed fella really needs to watch jordan Peterson&rsquo;s lectures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I watched Fed rise  and thrive in the streamer community. But now,  he has destroyed the one thing he vowed to protect.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Its kind of poetic: you die a hero or you live long enough to become a vilain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TLDR : Fed was acting like a huge dick towards everyone and he got what he deserved</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>im a tier 3 sub to fed watch your mouth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Toast is the man, he knows a lot and is trying to make everything good, and at least he is the one that can broke up in the most humane way</p>
</li>
