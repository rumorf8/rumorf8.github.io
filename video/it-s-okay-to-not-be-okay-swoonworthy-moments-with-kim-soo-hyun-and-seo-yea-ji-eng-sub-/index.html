<li>
<p>Mun Yeong breaking all those female lead cliche and just vocal and fearless as she is. Such a spirit animal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This drama is a masterpiece because:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acting 💯</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chemistry 💯</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Storylines 💯</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ok but you seriously didn’t film any content except Jenga? Wtf?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No kdrama can compete with it&rsquo;s okay to not be okay their chemistry is no joke I need a season 2 or another drama with them staring as the lead roles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who misses these two so much and can&rsquo;t start any other drama cuz they can&rsquo;t get over this drama 😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Swoon, this is not what we want. We are waiting for couch talk and more games or interviews with the cast!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If they really be dating in real life, they definitely get the title of &ldquo;Korea&rsquo;s powerful couple&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really love their kissing scenes. I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of kissing scenes on dramas but this one is different considering that this drama is not for adults ONLY. Love the casts and the staff. Rooting for the 2 of you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even the Swoon can&rsquo;t get over this drama like us</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GIVE US THE COUCH TALK GIVE US SOMETHING NEW WITH SOOHYUN AND YEJI</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m literally re-watching the whole drama from episode 1, that&rsquo;s how bad I miss them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THE COUPLE OF THE YEAR. PERIODT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me: tries to move on from this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Swoon: posts this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me: AKskjdfnnfriuyhbyewufilefne</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I lost count how many times I cried while watching this

<li>
<p>Usually we wish the main leads to act together in another drama or movie, but in this I want everyone , literally everyone who acted in this drama to act again together in another one&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mun Yeong = the horniest female lead character to exist in the entire kdrama history</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That &lsquo;8&rsquo; dislikes were definitely  from Mun Yeong&rsquo;s mother, I swear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am completely speechless. Every scene, dialogue and character is god blessed and beyond my imaginary. Ost of this drama are sooo soothing and heart touching. Oh yes, how can I forget that deer?  He also did great job, must win a award😊 I really love this drama. Hats off to all team member. Hoping for part 2. Thank you The Swoon for this video🌹🌹🌹</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looks like swoon is not getting over it&rsquo;s okay to not be okay and tbh not even us😭😂btw swoon you gave us only one content from IOTNBO 😭 you have no idea how depressed im ..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yoww everything in this drama is perfect. The chemistry, dark humor, storyline and everything HAHAHAHA you&rsquo;ll never get tired of watching it.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>TRULY A MASTERPIECE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I came to the conclusion that KSH and SYJ are VIP&rsquo;s actors, because we barely have content of both. lol Like we really have very cute moments at the beginning of the series but at the end of those bts we rarely saw KSH and SYJ moments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All scenes are worthy. Couch talk and other games with iotnbo cast is what we need rn. 🙏🖤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I won’t say they are moon couple because it basically their character. I would like to say Hyunji couple as it their name 😂😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you read my mind</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their first and last kiss would be the sweetest and purest kiss I&rsquo;ve ever seen on kdramas 🥺💞</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji chose the best characters for themselves. It was not an easy drama to portray and pour out emotions through expression, you also have to give 100% in your body language also. In human healing drama&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not easy to act on, but they did their best&hellip;and I&rsquo;m so proud of them. I hope that they will achieve more in their coming life. And I really wish to watch them in another season (2nd season)  of IOTNBO or in some other drama as the leads. Hope for the best❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They&rsquo;re beautiful, they&rsquo;re going to make me cry, I can&rsquo;t accept that I end up❤️😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go moon young really broke every kdrama standard that the man has the do the flirting and pursing in the relationship, she literally tried to eat kangtae every chance she get and we loved it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After watching this drama , all other dramas feel so bland&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally a kdrama where the lead characters doesn&rsquo;t kiss like elementary school kids</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love their chemistry and sexual tension. Kim soo-hyun, Seo Yea-ji, always in my mind and my heart. My hyunji🥰❤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second weekend without #ItsOkayToNotBeOkay and who still having hard time move on from this masterpiece 🙋🏻‍♀️

<li>
<p>The swoon never really fails to give and reminisce the parts that I loved from a certain kdrama. Thanks The Swoon I really luv ur videos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ts Okay to Not be Okay is just too beautiful, refreshing, and captivating to easily move on from. But I dont mind. Still, thank u Swoon, for &ldquo;grieving&rdquo; with us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Still refusing to move on from this drama.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay to not be okay made a great impact and each and every roles are too easy to connect with our life!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was emotionally connected with this kdrama!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>yeji is soohyun&rsquo;s best on-screen partner, periodt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need more Hyunji 😭! Rewatching IOTNBO for the 30th time now. Swoon, please if you have more content with them&hellip;please share!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really ship Hyunji. And if you do make this blue</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>👇🏻</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Power couple of Kdrama! They are taking the world by storm with their amazing acting skills and insanely perfect 🔥 chemistry 😊❤️😍 ( now praying for their happy ending together in real life!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need more for hyunji content, can you give us another content or jenga with no cut😭😭😭😭😭😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>guess swoon also cant move on but then where’s couch talk and others??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well, this is one of the drama that I have watched that has a moment of intense staring each other in between of kissing scenes. It seems that they are really comfortable to each other. I hope for the best for the both of them as well as to the whole staff and cast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What I can&rsquo;t understand is they freaking had a photoshoot on a couch and then they don&rsquo;t have couch talk? Make it make sense, swoon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seriously? How can we move on!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Need a support club! 😭😭😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The character development from Ep 1-16 is just WOW!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last time I shipped someone in a kdrama this hard was the Honey Couple, now? Moon Couple surpassed them and ruined me for my next kdrama viewings huhuhuhu will miss them in one drama together 💖💖</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They about to kiss then this deer just come in and ruin the moment😂🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i love how they are not trying to be innocent to express the love just like other dramas. This drama sets the bar really high.

<p>I need a season 2 of It&rsquo;s Okay to Not be Okay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The moment you can&rsquo;t watch any kdrama after watching this . Season 2 pleaseee! Also the chemistry of this two is just overflowing.💕❣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There&rsquo;s a hole in my heart after finishing this and idk what to watch to fill the void.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fun fact: In the scene where he carries her, he suggested (insisted) to make the scene in that way. First, because Yea-ji was uncomfortable. Second, the power of their chemistry  my darlings😎❤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who disliked this video are the ANTS! 😂 Ko Mun Yeong is the one and only of Gangtae! 😍</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk and I&rsquo;m sleepy is a big SCAM🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I cant get over her eye smile. How can someone look this pretty smiling. God has favorites i swear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>phew, geez. She really had to chase his ass &amp; wear him down to get some in the end. He is a tough cookie 😳😫</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m not saying that these two own my heart but that’s exactly what I’m saying..😭😍❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These two will forever remain in my top 5 OTP🙌🏻❤️❤️</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>when you already rewatch this drama 10x times per week and still watch this video be like :</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I need a season two! I don’t know what about, but I want more!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish we had more content with them like other kdramas. 🙏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This drama really helped open my eyes in a few ways. Opened it so I could see from other peoples perspectives somewhat. Thank you. Goodbye It&rsquo;s okay to not be okay. Great show!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t know how to feel. Should I feel grateful that we got this, or should I feel angered, mad, sad that we didn’t get more interviews?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WE NEED HYUNJI COUCH TALK, COMPLIMENT ME, ETC PLSSSS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monyoung is everyone’s spirit animal. Or sooo we wish&hellip;.😂😂😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It took me two weeks to watch another kdrama after finishing this one. I can&rsquo;t even binge watch Backstreet Rookie because I still think of this drama.

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>hahaaaaahaha i&rsquo;m already on my 14th episode for the second time around, still savoring every moment. my day isn&rsquo;t complete without watching any of their clips. I&rsquo;ll be a fan of them forever. 😅❤</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>So is no gonna talk about Yeji&rsquo;s voice in 2:38</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;lL BE DEAD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of Kim Soo Hyun.  I&rsquo;m very happy to watch his 1st drama after his military.  I&rsquo;m so proud of him, he did very well, his acting performance is so excellent.  Hyunji is the best couple I&rsquo;ve ever seen in Korea drama.  Looking forward to seeing them in next drama.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SWOON, PLEASE RELEASE THE UNCUT JENGA OF THE TRIO 😭😭😭😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ok that&rsquo;s it I am rewatching the whole show again.. Maybe I missed more scenes that I didn&rsquo;t even know I missed akdniehdnxkfn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’ve rewatched this series for about 5 times already. Hoping for more projects with them together as leads 💓

<li>
<p>i could fall off my chair while swooning i just want them to date get married and have beautiful babies is that too much to ask???? my phone is full of their pictures from on screen to off screen moments I COULD DIE watching these two separately they are amazing no doubt but together its fire on fire</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That last kiss after Munyeong confessed her love for Gangtae is the sweetest &amp; sincerest kiss of them. Because finally, Munyeong has completely been sincere in her feelings for Gangtae as opposed to the first time she said &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; to him in Ep.4 ❤❤ Ahhhh I can&rsquo;t move on from this drama. I&rsquo;ve rewatched the entire series thrice over the two weekends since it ended just to fill the void in my weekend drama habit. This is the best drama of 2020 for me. It has touched my heart more than any dramas I&rsquo;ve watched so far this year. And Kim Soo Hyun was right when he said this is a human healing drama. Indeed it is. And I love the cinematography as well as the soundtrack. The background music and the songs used in the drama evokes so much emotion. More importantly, the three main leads KSH, SYJ and OJS were all superb in their portrayal of their character&mdash; I cried and laughed with them in every scene. Overall, the best! Love love love them! ❤💙💚💛</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need coach talk and compliment with them as a guest star, please.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>swoon really said &ldquo;no one&rsquo;s gonna get over&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I came for the drama because of Kim Soo Hyun but I ended up falling for Seo Ye Ji and up until now I&rsquo;m still longing for this two I miss them already❤️😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their chemistry, the storyline, everything, I’m in love with this drama omg. I miss them so much AHHHH</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drama is on top, but all we got is Jenga. Life really is unfair</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The best kdrama for me 😭❤️ I miss them so much huhu</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ko Moon Young is officially my favorite kdrama leading lady ever (second fave is Jung GeumJa) What a boss lady! With everything she&rsquo;s been through with her parents she really has fought through and survived well considering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gosh i like the girl who always control the guy in every episode. that&rsquo;s why i shipped them🥰🥰😍</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My first time supporting an on screen couple because of their undeniable sexual off the chart chemistry and all I get is 3 contents from Swoon. Poor me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This entire show was perfectly casted, but I swear, the director struct gold when he decided up choose these two as the main couple for this series.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seriously im watching this with teary eyes. Really miss them. A lot. If there was no pandemic, i will fly to South Korean this December. Already bought the ticket,but my country still in MCO. 😭I hope Gold Medalist can updates about them asap. I miss them..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Swoon this isn’t enough, we want couch talk and compliment each other. If you won’t give those then I believe on my delusional mind that there’s something behind these two ☺️😋</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watched this for my man kim soo hyun but fell hard for Ko mun yeong and Seo ye Ji. I m a big Seo ye Ji fan now. 💯❤️ she is such a queennnn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have been replaying the whole drama more than 10 times on my 2nd computer. I never thought I could fall in love with a drama. Big fan of them both now!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i fell in love with kim soo hyun from the beginning in this drama</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did I just waste 14 mins of my life? NOPE, I DIDN&rsquo;T!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think she is the best actress who can do this character. Deep voice, strength, every thing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fun fact : the antagonist in this drama is actually that deer😂😂

</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for this moment, but i want (not only me, maybe we) more more kim soohyun and seo yea ji moment outside of their act, can be couch talk or many interview or games with them, love the swoon if you accept our request:)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the swoon really not letting us move on from this drama are they</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dislike is the from the people who didn’t get over yet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m gonna cry because I miss them a lot 😭😍😍😍</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you Swoon since we miss them SO MUCH, but hey, no other content with them ? Seriously?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i literally can’t move on bruv i’m constantly checking for updates on them everyday like damn WE NEED MORE CONTENT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh my poor heart &hellip; can’t move on from the hottest couple on Kdramaland. 😭😭😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The home sceme when she comrs to kang tae&rsquo;s house is too funny!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The moment he cursed the deer back&hellip;. That was character development in its finest and one of the funniest moments ❤️❤️❤️❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 28 dislikes were all given by that &lsquo;gorani saeggi&rsquo; in portest of this video. That deer couldn&rsquo;t believe our MoonMoon couple got so many swoon worthy moments despite its effort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m crying again 😭❤ They are so cute together ❤</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Edit: I almost forgot, but they also gave an ending to each of their subplots, like a mini happy ending for all the other supporting characters, that&rsquo;s usually so rare! I was attached to all of the characters and not just our lovely leads, so that was so nice to see!😭😭❤️</p>

<p>Is there any in the wrap up party?? We want to see one please!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i will never get over their chemistry LIKE it’s literally so natural and their kiss scenes seem like they aren’t acting 🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I loved all the moments but I was waiting for Munyeong - Sange Tae for moments as well like im sorry but Mangtae fight is iconic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I miss this drama so much, I will never forget the lessons I learned, I even memorise a lot of dialogues+ their chemistry is unbeatable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am sure I am going to rewatch it a lot of times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really wish i could see them again in another drama, i just love their chemistry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This drama made me cry so hard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seems like you&rsquo;re missing them, nado The Swoon, nado.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can see them again at the awards show, hoping they will bag all the awards for this drama.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For now,it&rsquo;s time to rewatch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Honestly Im against animal cruelty but they need to make the season 2 about how that deer should be sorted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really miss the casts from Main to supporting and cameos also the episodes that you must don’t miss it💓</p>

<p>Honestly this drama is so amazing that i would erase my memory just to watch it again for the first time&hellip;I CANNOT GET OVER IT AND I&rsquo;LL NEVER WILL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m falling in love with this All over again.. ,,and again and again!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We want a couch talk!!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i just cant moveon from this drama sobsob &lsquo;((</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After seeing the scenes back to back, you realize writer Jo Yong really loves to reuse lines. The &ldquo;Saranghae&rdquo; scene, &ldquo;Why is your face red?&rdquo; said first by MY then later by GT after the b&rsquo;day kiss, the &ldquo;shut up you crazy deer!&rdquo; line, the &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not crazy, you&rsquo;re cool&rdquo; line (their convo at the balcony), and I probably miss many more still. It&rsquo;s like everything coming full circle. That&rsquo;s what you call good writing!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>post-drama interview? :&gt; 😭🥺 i just miss them so much</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is bold,fearless, beautiful 😘😍i jus love her personality in the drama.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the swoon cant move on with this drama, like me 😋😍</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I still cant move one from this drama&hellip; I want to see the trio &ldquo;MmM&rdquo; work together again in a new drama!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I expected I new content from I guess only the Jenga game is what they have.  😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>swoon please let us know if there is no couch talk filmed or any games with iotnbo cast in it so we won&rsquo;t be waiting for it. But we&rsquo;re still hoping thou.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I miss this drama so much😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I need more of their new vids, BTS, interviews &amp; photos together!!! I need them back 😭😭😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t watched any kdrma after IONTBO.. i really can&rsquo;t let go&hellip;😢😢😢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s been 2 weeks post PBIO and they still live in my head rent free. I miss them so and wish we had more bts or other content</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Swoon U just uploaded this one yet you havent released any content other than Jenga???! So we literally just got only 1 Hyunji content from you Swoon? Seriously?!Pls drop the couch talk/compliment me, etc now!! ☹️☹️☹️😤😤😤</p>
