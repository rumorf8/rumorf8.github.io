<li>
<p>Fun fact: She crosses planets in seconds but takes an hour to take the gauntlet to the van.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weird how everyone in the universe speaks the same language</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Black widows sandwich got more screen time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apparantly Brie filmed this before shooting Captain Marvel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That moment when thanos realizes his head isn’t as strong as Brie’s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most powerful character: 4 mins screen time in a 3 hr movie.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Any more questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/HKo9fhpqnW8">https://youtu.be/HKo9fhpqnW8</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anybody else not understand the “she’s got help scene”, like apparently all these chicks with guns and shit are gonna help the woman who just flew through a fricken spaceship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brie as Capt Marvel is like melting ice&hellip; cold at first but eventually warms up.  She brings something interesting and objectionable in the MCU. I want to see her build chemistry with the other Avengers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish we could have seen Carol have some sort of a reaction to meeting Steve Rogers. As part of the armed forces, she would have known about Captain America for sure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn less then 4 minutes. Didn’t think it was that short. That’s harsh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that superman moment when she enters the fight and destroys the ship is iconic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how she didn&rsquo;t budge at his headbutt. 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish captain marvel and Captain America had more scenes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love how carol used a black widow move to take thanos&rsquo;s back</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested for more Captain Marvel movies. I found the first movie&rsquo;s storyline to be interesting, want to know more about the Kree and the wars she been fighting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>0:24.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh&hellip; this part is always heartbreaking. And probably because she was so eager to go after Thanos on her own. Carol spent years of her life outside Earth, trying to help people outer space, and when she comes back, finds out that not only half of the life in the universe was destroyed, but also one of her few friends was killed during it. Poor Carol 😓😥.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brie actually bring the character to life. Her self confidence, her sassy older sister personality is really on point because thats how Carol Danvers is in the comics. So good job Brie👏👏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Captain Marvel is awesome.  I love it when she glows&hellip;.that means she is kicking some serious butt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I liked her screentime more in her own movie and I hope she&rsquo;ll have more screentime in upcoming movies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:55 &ldquo;Uh, what are you going to do Mantis? This is going to get pretty violent, really quick, you may want to sit this one out&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love when she says answer the question</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love the scene when she’s coming out of the sky with the ship saving Tony and Nebula and as she drops it she does that look back&hellip;.reminds me of T’challas first appearance in Civil War when he looks back seeing Black widow&hellip;just the look of concern&hellip;also Carols first time back to earth in years&hellip;.that scene was quick but it hit different knowing all the movies the nostalgia 🖖🏽</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when she took on Thanos’ headbutt without a flinch I became a stan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wish they had shown other Avengers reacting to her takedown of the ship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love Captain marvel , black widow and scarlet witch I would like to see them together in a movie but I think it&rsquo;s not possible now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dr. Strange - &ldquo;Did we miss anyone&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:12  sees Captain Marvel, Dr. Strange- Oh, we did miss one person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i’ll never understand why people hate her so much srly&hellip; people say she’s arrogant but honestly i could name a few fan favourites who are arrogant as well lol i mean she’s not my favourite but she’s pretty cool 🤷🏻‍♀️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how badass looking Carol (Brie) has in this character. A superhero with a thug mood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kong Skull Island..Brie Larson also stars in it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They hyped her up like she was the worlds only hope and she didn’t do much</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m in love with her jawline&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazing Captain Marvel&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:33</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Okoye: why was she up there all this time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Haircut or not, she fine.

<li>
<p>My girl captain marvel out here being a badass without even trying&hellip;..gosh im proud right now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I Think Captain Marvel Should Of Started First As a Marvel Movie Back In The Day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That suit comes across so well on screen, kind of like Iron Man. It just pops, and the CGI works really well. The character is a real badass, Marvel really did her well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that captain marvels hair is CGI at 1:33 is mind blowing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s my girl! Much love for Captain Marvel!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>😍I Love Captain Marvel💛</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There could be a chance that Cap.Marvel knows Thanos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Im really disappointed she only got 3 minutes of screen time. She needed to be in this more. WTF Russos?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I liked her as Envy Adams in Scott Pilgrim Vs The World.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how when she remembered Nick Fury ‘died’ from the blip, she was really upset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Captain marvel is my favorite avenger, her charismatic personality is unsurpassed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THANK YOU SO MUCH! I’ve been looking for these scenes for millennia</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Captain Marvel MARVELLOUS woman</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s not enough! We want more!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Besides the talking scenes, she literally gets the same amount of screen time as Scarlet Witch, and Wanda did as much or even more than her lol. But I mean she’s powerful tho.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She fought Thanos with 6 Infinity Stones, and stood her ground. What a beast</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish there was more screen time for her😌</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wish that she had more screen time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would like to see captain marvel vs scarlet witch vs Thor there all the strongest ones</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She looks good without her haircut.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cap marvel was able to take on thanos head on&hellip;( That infinity power stone got her out ) but since she is stronger than thanos she could have snapped her fingers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:10 Thanos- “Nooo, my chair!!!!!”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The headbutt sounds like a beach ball being thrown against a wall oh my god🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love captain marvel watched the dvd so many times👍.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I LOVE CAPTAIN MARVEL!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I LOVE BRIE LARSON AS CAPTAIN MARVEL!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you bet!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love! Captain marvel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I watched it for the second time ever today and I noticed a big difference with the ending.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In my copy it show Fury typing his &ldquo;Avengers&rdquo; Initiative after seeing Carol&rsquo;s nickname but the copy on Disney+ doesn&rsquo;t have that scene! What gives?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most op character didnt have enough screen time to be monetized by youtube in the final conclussion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She looks so damn good with that haircut, although she looks awesome either way. My favorite avenger ♥️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love her ✨✨</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:30 That Superman shot, all heroes that can fly have done that on the big screen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3:28 Last time a female superhero got head-butted by a superpower guy, they ended up on the ground.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Would have been nice if she head-butted him back, like the other two did to each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like how she destorys the ship with ease and some how cant fly through fleshy baddies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes , I came here just to say to Brie Cheese: Elizabeth Scarlet Witch is the BEST!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She’s much better in Endgame than in her own movie tho

<p>3:24</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanos: Headbutts Captain Marvel as hard as possible.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Captain Marvel: &ldquo;Like whatever dude&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Thanos: &ldquo;OH SHI..!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THANKS FOR THIS. She was there at the right times. The most EPIC moments. LOVE HER! The best hero</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so it&rsquo;s just about 4 minutes? 🤯</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i was very excited for the captain marvel scenes in endgame, i thought she would be the exact hero to finished all problems that thanos did. nick fury did call her before he dusted and it&rsquo;s very lit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>but now, don&rsquo;t give me hope marvel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hot ,, hot hot,,she’s so bad ass❤️✌️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:05 &ldquo;so you might not see me for a long time&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Yeah we didn&rsquo;t see you until the end of the movie after this&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1:41 I don&rsquo;t know but I like this &ldquo;Answer the question&rdquo; &lt;333</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine dead thanos seeing his own self in this demsion while in hell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love that scene with Thanos bare-fisting the Power Stone so much, that was inspired. Completely organic, and yet completely unexpected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When u realize the British empire colonized all universe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liked the smirk on her face when thor received his stormbreaker.

<li>
<p>So excited for her sequel. Brie plays Carol Danvers so well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such a shame she had such a small amount of screen time. Yet another character that was let down by the writers/directors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Would have loved to see more of her in Endgame but it pisses me off that we won&rsquo;t see Brie in the MCU for 3-4 years or so. Still she&rsquo;s the strongest avenger and not to mention, she&rsquo;s such a beautiful goddess.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me: what if she cut her hair bald</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You know life is sad when a tree has more facial expression than you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>she was the first avenger but she&rsquo;s the last one that was showed that she&rsquo;s part of them and if she&rsquo;s in. infinity war there will be no end game cuz she&rsquo;s powerful</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanos should be die if he doesn’t use power stone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only reason they kept her out of the entire film is because she’s the only one who can beat Thanos 1 on 1 and fight against the infinity stones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They should&rsquo;ve left her hair long.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ahh her with her haircut!!! I&rsquo;m so in love!!!!! They really said captain marvel is for the gays and the gays alone thank you and good night</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>0:54 yeah but thanos was on THIS planet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:40 Peter X Carol Ship Moment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just imagine if they put ryan reynold as deadpool in that movie..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3:30 that was SO BADASS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3:36 Smart move tho, that took so much IQ and focus fighting a Godlike power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how captain marvel can shoot through many layers of (who’s knows how strong) metal and yet she can’t make a dent into thano’s armour and skin</p>

<li>
<p>I like how Thanos is like &ldquo;Wtf? How?&rdquo; when she just glares at him after he tries to headbutt her and she don&rsquo;t even flinch. xD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only reason he sent her flying was because he used an infinity stone, lol. Or he would probably have lost that battle, which he probably realized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ah, this is perfect. The few good scenes of this movie collected nicely. Pretty much the only things I took away from this movie.

<li>
<p>Captain Marvel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abilities :</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thor: I like this one</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me: finally, someone who I can gossip with</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“I watch Avengers Endgame for the plot”                 The plot:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1:00 listen closely, someome whispers &ldquo;telepathy&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Captain Marvel always with and always melts my heart n makes me so happy ♥</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Captain M:&ldquo;The whole universe needs my help, you probably won&rsquo;t see me for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 days later</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avenger&rsquo;s:Yeah you really were needed huh?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the scenes of Endgame I fast forwarded through.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Natasha’s peanut butter jelly sandwich has more screen time than her</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:30 her theme!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tony&rsquo;s thoughts when he saw a flying shiny beautiful blond woman in such a situation :</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&hellip; I&rsquo;m dead, aren&rsquo;t I ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>thank you for saving me the 3 hrs of avengers endgame just to watch the captain marvel cameos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So lemme get this straight</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tony Sacrifices himself later on in the film</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And Carol saved Tony in the Beginning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So technically she indirectly saved all The Avengers

<li>
<p>0:53 wow talking about coming high and mighty. Yeah what consolation is that when half th universe still got erased?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how she knows where the avengers building is, she&rsquo;s a walking Google maps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even a fan of Captain Marvel&hellip;but 3 minutes seems pitiful with how much Disney hyped her up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well she was hit with powerstone,  now she will be even more POWERFUL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She absorbs all forms of energy including that from the infinity stones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BAM!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The part where she tries to stop Thanos a second time was pretty tense/exciting in the theater seeing it for the first time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is Amazing 😍</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Captain Marvel is so beautiful!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bruh if she can fly close to the speed of light (as seen at the ending of captain marvel) why was she going so slow when she had the gauntlet like bruh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love Captain Marvel and Black Widow and Scarlet Witch&hellip; such beautiful women&hellip; so in love</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:42 to 2:44 When I saw this scene I thought she wants the d because of her eyes and tone of voice combined together if anyone else though like that plz tell me in a reply</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 minutes in a 3 hours movie. That&rsquo;s marvelous !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:42 &ldquo;Hey, Peter Parker. You got something for me?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I prefer her so much when she have long hairs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freaking loved the “she’s got help” scene and was so glad in the theaters were people literally cheered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanos literally punched her to the funeral scene</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The length of this video tickles me joyfully</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just noticed the Gauntlet moved the firepit when they ambushed Thanos</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thor: I like this one

<li>
<p>Chris Hemsworth: Chokes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought that they were going to use Captain Marvel the same way that Scarlet Witch was used in IW: her powers came from the Space Stone, so she potentially could&rsquo;ve destroyed it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loved captain marvel, up until she cut her hair. She should of just tied it behind!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m gonna be honest here. I think Captain Marvel should’ve showed up much earlier in the final battle. That way the “Avengers Assemble” scene would’ve felt more complete</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh! Thank god Mantis was there to help her</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that this video is under 4 minutes long makes me so happy :')</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanos: Headbutts Captain Marvel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Captain Marvel:So you have chosen Death</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also thanos: YEET</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I guess she didn&rsquo;t need any help feom those other girls..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brie’s acting technique for captain marvel: say everything in a questioning or sarcastic tone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3:37 when he whips out the unapologetic masculinity stone.  equality this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1:11 I&rsquo;m starshipping these two</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So many haters . At the end of the day her net worth  is more than all of us combined</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Okay for those of you claiming they nerfed thanos in the mcu, that’s it true but so are many other characters! They don’t want to be like the DCEU, where The JL isn’t needed, only superman!</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>But I wouldn’t say captain marvel is stronger than thanos or the other way around. She needs help battling thanos at the beginning of endgame where thanos is at his weakest!  The battle with Thanos(2), you can clearly see he tossed her around! When he finally puts on the infinity gauntlet and begins to use it, captain marvel grabs it and overpowered Thanos BECAUSE captain marvel’s power is energy absorption! You can see she is absorbing the power and thanos headbutts didn’t do no damage,(he literally grabs her arm and tosses her away with his strength alone like a few second before)! He sees that and grabs the power out of the gauntlet to shoot her away! Watch the freaking movie and also understand where each character gets their power from!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>kudos to Endgame for including her theme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Her acting is really wooden &amp; unenthusiastic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OK, so it’s pretty obvious Cap Marvel beats stoneless Thanos 9/10 times. How about Cap Marvel vs Hela?

<li>
<p>A queen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just love how all the women stopped battle at the same time to eavesdrop on Captain Marvel&rsquo;s conversation with Spider-Man and to give her help she clearly didn&rsquo;t need. I additionally love how they wanted to showcase the women of Marvel but the most popular and intrical woman of the MCU was already dead</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It would be funny if capt marvel blast all enemies when okoi said&quot;she got help&rdquo; 😂😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>02:12 smashes thru spaceship, then &ldquo;hey Peter Parker&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is perfect and beutifull. I love is Brie Larson!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1:12 the line that started a thousand fan fics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:36</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strongest and more obviously powerfull</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So I have a question why didn’t she just get the flerken kitty to swallow the stones ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:47 Okay buuuuuuut 3:01 Yeah I don&rsquo;t think she needs it&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Literally no one:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thor: I like that one</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love her glow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They should’ve kept that badass helmet.  Plus in her movie, her hair through the helmet was on fire which just added to the coolness.  Instead we just get&hellip;.none of that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is a not endgame for avengers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the enemy leader is stronger than Thanos is coming</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>do you know who he is?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Red 💀 Skull

<li>
<p>Funny how people said Captain Marvel had like 10-15 minutes of screen time when way less than 5 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WTF I love her with hair cut.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t have to seem young and beautiful. She is the strongest HERO who protect the universe in MCU.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the most dead inside actor i have ever seen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So.. End game wouldn&rsquo;t ever happen if captain marvel come earlier.. She&rsquo;s OP AF..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for someone who had lost one of his eyeball, thor looks really cool about it</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>i&rsquo;d be hysterical</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brie Larson makes a great Capt. Marvel. For fan fiction&hellip; I want to see her go up against Melissa Benoist&rsquo;s Supergirl.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love how she gets punched so hard she isn’t seen for the rest of the fight and pretty much the movie</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love her</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well that was more screen time then she actually got in the real movie 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My favorite character! I can’t wait for captain marvel 2!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think if captain marvel didn’t disappear for 80% of the movie, defeating Thanos would have been 10x easier</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Id prefer the Helmet when shes on the space&hellip; Its more accurate in real life. Than exposing her self in vacuum space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Captain marvel makes a great mother lol still can’t believe I met her this weekend the feelings aren’t quite there yet the minute I saw her I knew I’d like her unlike the criticism out there</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The strongest avenger👌🏼</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3:00 who notice that was girl power time and Peter Parker was just sitting there</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Would have been nice if in the big fight she’d ruffled Peter Parker’s hair, winked, and said - ‘No, we got this.’

<li>
<p>I really like her in this. If they make her more this in the next captain marvel it might be a decent film.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unpopular opinion: I like Captain Marvel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I still dont get how mantis contributed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thor and Carol - 💏💑 forever!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Where you going” “to kill thanos”🤮</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just me but I feel even when she &ldquo;snaps&rdquo; back her voice is low and calm. Quite different than in her own movie.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Too bad we won&rsquo;t see her interact with Peter anymore. He would have needed someone like Carol to guide him. Oh well MCU has Ms. Marvel now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A pesar de que muchos fan no es del agrado ella como Capitána Marvel, a mi me Encanta ❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now i know why only one eyes function HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>-Fury</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You telling me we got a movie about her, just so she can have less than 4 minutes of screen time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would love to see her hair short if shes tall but unfortunately it isnt so ill stick with the long hairdo style</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nat: Carol, are we seeing each other next month?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Danvers: Not likely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is really depressing. She was the highlight for me hands down. 3.5 mins. Yikes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>without power stone, Thanos would have been toasted by her</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I  wished Vision would back to our Scarlet Witch :c</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They deserve better</p>
</li>
