<p>Dammit fed, next thng we&rsquo;re gonna see is Toast going to get kicked out for his open bromance between the male offlinetv members</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But tbh Yvonne did try to talk about it to Fed but he just kept saying he doesnt remember, so there litterally is no further talking about it. If she did further talking ,he would just deny or give a pacifistic reply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>im really happy that everyone took yvonnes story seriously. My old friend group there was a guy (we were &ldquo;friends&rdquo;) who molested me after i passed out when we were drinking  and i told my friends who i felt closest with and they acted like nothing happened so that they can keep status quo. I had to see my friends all hanging out while i had to pretend nothing happened. Lets just say i was alone for awhile</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So the Videos back then with the title &ldquo;Fed did what to her roomate&quot;wasn&rsquo;t a clickbait</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Honestly I was growing towards liking fed so much watching otv&rsquo;s videos and his streams but listening and reading this hurts me so much like why, fed, and im not going to hate on him, but im just really hurt as a fan of everyone in OTV especially Fed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edit: It hurts more now knowing that Fed was also emotionally and mentally hurting his closest friends, especially Poki, Yuna and Moe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn this sucks bad&hellip; Honestly reminds me of an old &lsquo;friend&rsquo; from back in freshman year of college. Dude was genuine chill, kind, sweet man. He&rsquo;d offer food, help with homework, was there for support, etc. But then he hit this bad low with his relationship, broke up, and became lonely and frankly unstable. On casual days hed be his cool bro self, but suddenly he&rsquo;d be attempting to hit up random girls. And pressured too far. Accidently stalking one getting him in trouble with the campus security, there was another who called him a creep and pushed him away, and general getting shot down every other week. We then sat him down and like it is. He was just not mentally sound. Broken and lonely after the break up he was acting out. And that he needed help. Since then it seemingly stopped, but he moved away and hope he got out of that rough state. But anyways,  Like Fed, i think yeah, he is good people, but acting out of desperation or loneliness. He needs help, and to truthfully fix himself, and hopefully come out of that state. Best wishes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I mean he did pee on a chair when he was drunk. Fed should not drink</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even know how to feel about him. i genuinely feel sorry, but still&hellip;. not really ok</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone who attacks Yvonne in defense of Fed misrepresents him and makes him out to look worse, what he did was wrong obviously but when you scroll through Yvonne&rsquo;s twitter and see comments antagonizing her it negatively reflects on Fed even though it&rsquo;s not coming from him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hearing this for the first time reminds me of how Fed has said previously that he strives to not be like his Father. But to me, him being super drunk strips him down to just being a product of his environment. Feelsbadman. I ain&rsquo;t trying to cover his ass for his actions, just giving another perspective on him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wasn’t around during the Japan incident, I guess this is what people felt when that happened. I don’t like the feeling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I always felt that there was something more between Yvonne and Fed then “being like brother and sister” like most of people described it. I mean even on her streams sometimes people were coming in and were hugging her but every time Fed came in and tried to hug her etc. she seemed a bit off if that makes sense</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I heard this news yesterday my heart dropped straight to my gut and felt like I, someone who really liked Fed, was betrayed. Like we all can say we really liked Fed and he had a lot of creativity and was really fun to watch in general. The entire time we trusted him to be so kind and be the awkward forever alone friend, but instead he turns out to be a bad drunk who over steps boundaries. Even if he was drunk, he’s still responsible for his actions - for people who blame it on the alcohol he still acted really sus as Anber had said. This entire situation is derived from Fed not holding himself up for his actions and slipping up back to past actions, even if it’s on accident. I’m aware that people can change, but it takes a while. The OfflineTV guys really do love him. They gave him a chance to change and he slipped up. Now the consequence is being kicked out. I really hope Fed can change and possibly mend his relationship with them, but I don’t expect them to. This entire situation is just, so fucking sad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>even if she didnt say no she didnt say yes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>first albert and now fed, i swear if toast is the next one im done

<li>
<p>I think you did a really good job covering this situation. It&rsquo;s really heartbreaking to find out that Fed was like this behind the scenes, and even more so that Yvonne, Lily, and Poki kept so much to themselves to try and preserve their friendship and OTV. Thanks for being so respectful</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I kinda expected this, there was so much of him talking about sex and stuff, even I felt uncomfortable watching sometimes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bruh fed is like every 5th grader who watched a &ldquo;how to get a girlfriend&rdquo;  video and took it seriously</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard from many other that r close to offline tv that fed done more things and half of them was when he wasn&rsquo;t drunk as well, for example, everytime poki was out and having fun and have a interest with a man, fed goes to the man and say that he was dating poki and stuff even though they weren&rsquo;t, basically making it so poki couldn&rsquo;t get a boyfriend easily</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Silence doesn&rsquo;t mean &lsquo;yes&rsquo;, people. So the &ldquo;she didn&rsquo;t say no&rdquo; excuse is not valid anymore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This kinda ruined my day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t spread hate to anyone btw</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not even fed. I&rsquo;ll hurt Yvonne to know that he is getting hate even after trying hard to protect him from it. The people in offline really cared/ care about fed he was close to all of them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yvonne: It&rsquo;s suspicious when a guy does something while drunk, doesn&rsquo;t remember while not drunk, and does it again while drunk fully aware of the last time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alcoholics can do things drunk they can&rsquo;t do otherwise like playing the piano or speaking Spanish, maybe he tried to use this as common sense to get his way, or he has a problem with drinking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing: one problem I felt when listening to this story is how OTV members being too nice and tolerant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To be precise, even you&rsquo;re close friends and what not, living in a house meaning does not mean everyone can easily disturb each other&rsquo;s personal boundary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just sexual harassment which is not acceptable whatsoever,  no excuse, no drama, end of story.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moral of the Story: If you drink Alchohol, be sure to store it in your stomach and not in your head.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2020&rsquo;s next target is the internet community</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Just look at the recent events happening in youtube/twitch etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fed just watched too much harem animes where mc suddenly finds himself in a house full of girls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Honestly, I think this is the end of offline tv 😔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think that many of you will want to prove me wrong but here&rsquo;s my opinion. Every person should get a last chance, even Fed, even with the things he has done, should be given a chance, he might be a better person, and I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s really not ok with what he has done, and the hate he received, he will try to be as good person as possible, and there&rsquo;s a probablity of scarra giving him like a trial month or something and depending on that, he might let him join the otv back. Even though you might think it&rsquo;s very unlikely, but there&rsquo;s still a chance, I believe there&rsquo;s a high chance though, I think everyone in the otv family still thinks some good about him. You guys might not like Fed, but I still like him as a content creator, he had really good interactions with the family, I enjoyed, and I started watching otv because of Fed. I know I&rsquo;m going to get comments like &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t even know what he has done&rdquo;, I do. I have watched every otv member/friend&rsquo;s video about Fed, and I know what he has done. I hope Fed will come back in better and bring us some enjoyable and fun content to us all. Thanks for reading this, and also sorry for some grammar mistakes, English is not my primary language.

<p>He&rsquo;s just a lonely dude in a bad environment for him, he is emotionally unstable and probably fantasizes about the women in his friends group. Having no way to express his emotions he probably keeps to himself, the only time he expresses his frustration and weakness is when he is intoxicated. Yes these are unhealthy signs to his instability that should not be ignored and he should seek cognitive behavioral therapy for them. It is no big news that me matter of how often he struck and missed receiving rejection, it is good for them to confront him about it and promptly remove him from their circle. If he would&rsquo;ve been aloud to continue he may cross a boundary that he&rsquo;d otherwise be unable to cross back again. I hope he does seek the help that he needs and that he pursues a life of singleness where he can find true happiness alone before complimenting his life with a woman who naturally wants to be a part of his.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the first video of yours I’ve watched, and dang is that some intro.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I loved fed the most, I still love him but it’s really sad that he’s gonna he gone and everything, im happy he’s getting professional help but it hurts me to know this happened. If he continues streaming and stuff I’ll gladly watch but I hope he becomes a better person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;You do not do that to a friend&rdquo;, YOU DO NOT DO THAT TO ANYONE! Regardless if it&rsquo;s your friend or a stranger, you do not touch anyone without their permission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>now i can no longer consume any otv contesnt bcz he was the reason only why i liked otv his mental condition got the best of him man this 2020 is constantly doing things to depress my sources of happiness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Im gonna try not to bias here” 3 minutes later: 3:48</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thats a rip for otv</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe there are people who have the nerve to still defend Fed.  What he did was inexcusable.  Plain and simple.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After reading a lot of comments I have to throw my 5 cents in to the matter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What he did. WAS sexual assault.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People are saying there was something flirty going on between the two and a lot of you might be right. But that doesn’t justify for his actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people act without empathy, without thinking about what it might affect in the future</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nice vid anb</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&lt;3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had a friend like him key word had now I wish I never see that person ever again but I still wish the best for him but I want to go through life with out ever seeing that person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is why i aviod alcohol. I never want to bring myself to a point where im hurting people and not even know it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oooooh so I finally understand what Yvonne was talking about on Dr K&rsquo;s stream during their &ldquo;therapy&rdquo; session, she cried when he asked her who she wanted to protect by saying nothing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This drama got me the Same feeling as Hartley Sawyer got fired from the Flash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently he got his memories back&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>What can I say drinks brings back memories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The people who are downplaying, ridiculing, and dismissing Yvonne&rsquo;s narrative are probably part of the problem. Can someone explain why jasmina&rsquo;s situation is not being taken seriously? Is she lying or somethin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>work on yourself fed, come back stronger. you&rsquo;re not a bad person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I remember watching the Halloween mafia vid and fed &ldquo;accidentally&rdquo; touching fuslie&rsquo;s breast. Honestly there were a few times fed acted a bit strange in the vids and it sucks so much hearing what he did. I haven&rsquo;t lost my complete respect for him but it ain&rsquo;t much left at this point</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just remembered that one time when Lily was on her room and Fed knocked on the door and she yelled &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; And he just asked &ldquo;are you dressed?&rdquo; And opened the door right away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m tired of people saying “they should have said NO”.. Oh my god did you even read the story? They DID say no, multiple times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Yvonne locked her door</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Yvonne and Lily literally have boyfriends</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is it everytime I get into a new group on YouTube, some type of Drama Pops off. How t.f this always happens? This year is absolutely nuts 💯</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dude played the song “fed up” in the outro, I’m dead 🤣🤣🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5:31</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me, has flashbacks to when Minion reserves ( Micheal reeves but he had a minion facemask on) lock picked the door and turn off the lights, then following to scare the living shit out of yvonne</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>btw read the text with the red underline to understand this further</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching otv for nearly a year now and I always thought with their dynamic that fed really liked Yvonne or that they were like an old married couple. Didn&rsquo;t think this would happen tho</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I first started watching offline TV I thought there was something weird about fed, I thought maybe he was just a weird guy I didn&rsquo;t understand and I also noticed that poki didn&rsquo;t seem very chill around him but I brushed it off, I guess now I know why I felt that way</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anber: I will not be on sides as I am telling this story.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Also Anber 2 sec later: But you see what I think happens was.</p>

<p>I have a lot of issues with both sides of the stories, but trying to look at this logically is frowned upon lol.

<p>This gives fed thinking lily was agreeing with a offline tv orgy, alot.. creepier..how sad I liked fed alot ;^;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Michael Reeves kicked out for tasing Lilypichu while sleep. Lily died due to michael setting taser power to 50 instead of 5</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I literally was kinda shipping Fed and Yvonne back then&hellip; this didn’t age well</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bruh i just don’t understand how people in their 20s dont have enough willpower or confidence to move when a guy touches them like wtfs happened in your life to make u not able to move</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lily’s been the common denominator the whole time, I’m just saying, three separate incidents lily is involved (chris, albert and now fed)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He lost his way. I remember his speech about wanting to keep the offlinetv together and prevent it from falling apart, why fed? WHY!? We&rsquo;re not mad, we&rsquo;re just sad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hmm virus, otv cancelling, war almost breaking out&hellip;&hellip;. alien invasion anyone?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nice video i like how you are still profesionell even when the story is that messed up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>anyone supporting fed supports blaming the victim, toxic masculinity, and are very insensitive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>7:12 what the hell do you mean completely understandable? If I encountered a sexual predator I would warn my friends and anybody I know about them, not be quiet to protect their friendship to the predator. Keeping quiet in such a situation makes them responsible if this happens to someone else. I get that Americans like to whitewash a lot and prefer pretending to like everyone as part of their culture, but come on that also has to have its limits. Life is no pony-farm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This hurts me man, I just recently started to watch FED and it hurts bc he seemed like a genuine guy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually glad that you broke professionalism to show your anger.  Really shows how you care about such a messed up situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>still dosent change the fact she should have done something anything leave the room ,scream,move ,push him .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can&rsquo;t blame alcohol, alcohol just shows what you really feel deep down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my charger broke and my phone died right before this all happened and when i came back all of it was chaos so basically my experience is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;it got alotta positive feedback&rdquo; heh heh. Fed heh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Yvonne had Amber’s voice I’d be dying bruh (just something light to add on this dark situation)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m scared that offline tv is going to stop because poki and fed are leaving</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>0:18 pls what song im losing my mind finding it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>damn, be thirsty for so long he became desperated

<li>
<p>i genuinely hope everyone in offline tv recovers from this. same goes for fed. he needs to learn that what he did was just plain awful. my heart goes out to all of them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3:32 I’m tryna take this seriously and listen to a sad story about sexual harassment and than this idiot chucks a flashbang right into his eyes and I was dying</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You did an awesome job reporting on this, you were very respectful of everyone in the situation and I really apreciate that. Keep up the good work!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tbh I&rsquo;ve always liked Fed the least.. He has never really been appealing to me. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s funny (not that anyone really cares what I think) because all of his humor is based around being lonely.. but he&rsquo;s lonely because he&rsquo;s a creep. He&rsquo;s always given me creep vibes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s good they stopped him before he did something worse to her it seems he was using the drunk excuse to test how far he can get with her</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tbh when I first saw fed he looked like someone I knew who did similar things. And now this is coming out and I cant act surprised, I tried liking him because I didnt have an &lsquo;actual&rsquo; reason not to like him as a otv member. He just always seemed like the desperate guy, from his personality. Not the desperate rapey guy. And no matter what anyone says, this is rapey tendencies. It seems like he knew who to go after to test how far he could get. And before he got too far, they all called him out before it was too late.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel so bad my dude i really liked the guy used to be my favorite one in the house idk why the fk he had to do that i feel so bad that we won&rsquo;t be seing him anymore ;(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At first I thought that it was just this stupid feminist &ldquo;oh no he touched me, he touched me!&quot;, but the I saw the whole story, and I have to say&hellip;. Fed, you went to far man&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know this is harsh and stuff but I feel like fed is gonna end his life. With covid and being kicked out, he could be really depressed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>im kinda neutral about this honestly. for yvonne im really sorry for that happening to her and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for fed i feel bad he’s getting cancelled. although what he did was very messed up, i still do not like cancel culture at all. just me though. people have different opinions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think that Fed wanted to have a relationship between OfflineTV members (or rather wanted to be with Poki) but he failed</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>and I think she will live long with his virginity</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>poor Fed :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Man, I just somewhat recently started watching them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most because of Micheal Reeves being so cool but dang.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So many problems happened in the group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cheating, attacking a youtuber source of income/sponcers, tabs that should’ve been left unseen, etc.

</li>
<li>
<p>I would like to think that if Fed took a  long break for everything and strived to be a better person then maybe just maybe he can become friends with them again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Honestly I’m shocked. Fed seemed to be the guy who everyone loved. He had great chemistry with everyone there, especially Yvonne. Sucks to see it happen. I hope he can get help and become a better person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>awwww  fed trying to be just like his idol epstein&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My micheal reeves instincts are kicking to protect someone with a giant death nightmare machine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I always got the bad vibes from Fed and Yvonne on stream together, same thing with Lily and Albert. I did bet with a friend that another guy would be kicked from the OTV after Albert. However, Michael is already so insane, but wholesome that I think he&rsquo;s a keeper. Scarra&rsquo;s Scarra, so of course he&rsquo;s pog, and Toast is a ladysman, so he&rsquo;s definitely a wild card in this whole shebang.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>true me&hellip; no friendship between boy and girl. he lived there so long and no girl accept him to be boyfriend even he ask them out. I think this is a good time for he to move out&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NEXT, Scarra</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think fed’s apology was genuine and he is just dumb. I hope he learns to become a better person like yevone said and that it ends up well. This video was a good unbiased overview of the situation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thx for making this vid, I love offline tv, but rarely follow their life. Its sad to see such events happen. I hope its all ends well for everyone, even for Fed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>really sad, didnt thougth fed would be like this&hellip;.. i feel sorry for laughing at the outro song (the song is called Fed up)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am not angry, I am disappointed. I hope he gets everything figured out and can change for the best.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He apologises alot. How many chances are they going to give him? They are too forgiving. They should burn that bridge and move on, no point trying to fix something that keeps breaking. Also they should make me a new member to the offlinetv team to replace him😂 lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think if Yvonne told fed the next day that he just can&rsquo;t do that but she didn&rsquo;t  she brushed it of because he said he didn&rsquo;t remember anything and your body pretty ducked up when your drunk. I mean if you don&rsquo;t warn then it&rsquo;s gonna happen again but fed as an adult should know more</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OfflineTv and Fed:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gives mature and respectful statement about the situation.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Internet:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Felt that the first time I watched clip that have Fed, Always take advantage to touch girls in OTV, Lmfao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m confused why the doors in the house doesn’t have locks

<p>I was hoping it wouldn&rsquo;t come to this, I always had some strange vibes from Fed but decided to ignore it, thinking I was just being judgemental. But man&hellip;I just hope Fed gets fixed up and soon, he&rsquo;s digging a hole where no one will be able to reach him from.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>well, that story sounds like fed has a split personality..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vid gets to the part where fed comes in abruptly. Then get an ad for nutrisystem with the ad starting with &ldquo;Knock, Knock&rdquo; then them opening the door. 😅😅</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just wanna say that most of the story is private as of now and that we can&rsquo;t necessarily tell what the full story is and not jump to conclusions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I dont know why but i had the feeling this was gonna happen because it seemed like fed was getting on everyones nerves mostly yvonne</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This dude just straight up trying to get harem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It genuinely saddens me that Fed mistreated his friends so horribly. He never struck me as a guy who could be capable of such things. I hope he can figure out a way to approach his sociopathological problems. He really seems like a good person at heart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people forget that boundaries are set by saying no&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my man was so lonely because he had no gf so he was forced to😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After pokimane left the OfflineTV house. Fed shows his true nature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow. My favorite otv member, gone because he drank and is an bad drunk, feels like betrayal..gg</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like fed took his dads personality when he&rsquo;s drunk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We love you Anber :3 keep up the great work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t already pokimane has explained everything on her twitch account</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what I dont understand is when theyre vlogging, live streaming, or working on something, they look all just normal. with the dirty jokes &amp; all but deep inside, theres this happening&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We not gonna notice this man&rsquo;s sick as vayne clutch in that teamfight or is it just me?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am so distraught right now. I had been watching otv for a long time now and this just came out of nowhere for me. First albert, now this? Offlinetv&rsquo;s members have really fallen from grace. It goes to show that sometimes seemingly good people make horrible decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I been following fed for years and hearing all these things is very shocking and disappointing. How would of thought.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Umm nope, he didn&rsquo;t get kicked out due to sexual harassment. He got kicked out because he acted very untrustworthy and it got to a point where everyone especially  the girls were not comfortable with him being around anymore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LOL Bro as soon as I heard Yvonne say that fed is like a brother I already knew he was in the friend zone and he just didn&rsquo;t know how to get out and he always wanted to smash. This situation being the case where he really wanted to do something but didn&rsquo;t know how to get out of the friend zone and it just festered into this one situation.

<p>Ay this happen in hentai everytime I watch enough hentai to understand this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That was not unbiased you didn&rsquo;t try, the edit shows that. Period. Fed needs to be held accountable, things are always shakey when substances are involved. But to the point of this comment as to this video. You got my view good job covering the news till this point. Still not unbiased and will not excuse it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I mean I freeze up when I’m scared why’s it a weird reaction?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sigh, Fed was like..I do no see him as a villain or someone out to hurt people for his selfish reasons, he&rsquo;s not a bad person, he&rsquo;s just dumb, he handled everything incorrectly and really messed up, hope he is able to get help, reflect on his actions and change for the better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This just shows how different the viewers perspective and the streamers perspective</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fed should just apologise the moment he went sober instead of acting dumb</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is really sad, I just wished that he changed before he had to deal with being kicked out of the house</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What fed did was bad but only thing I&rsquo;m thinking about is that im probably never watching offline tv again. Fed was kinda the main pillar making their content funny</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Welp, this whole thing is quite sad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bruh so i wont be able to see Fedmyster in Offline TV anymore?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right  when i was finaly getting into their channel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All I hoped after watching this video is that he does get better, he seem like a good friend but just didn’t know where to step back.  Maybe he felt to comfortable with his friends or lack for.. love? I really hope and wish he does become a better person and still talk to the offline tv time to time :) we are just watchers we don’t know how they feel&hellip; I somewhat experienced that feeling, and it’s hard to hate someone when you know you could’ve stopped it before it gets worse&hellip; just a lesson I learned</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>its confirmed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FED IS KIRA YOSHIKAGE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>just because someone doesn’t verbally or physically express they don’t want something sexual to happen, does not warrant consent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>me who has trouble remembering to knock on doors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looks like Albert has a buddy now 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AIGHT IMMA ADMIT WE GONNA MISS FED REGARDLESS OF THE DRAMA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m so disappointed. He was my favorite guy in otv.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damm this whole situation really hits me different x(

<li>
<p>Thx I only see reaction video and I didn&rsquo;t know what was happening 😅</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn i never thought fed would do this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>well&hellip; from yvonne&rsquo;s truth (wich seems to be everyone&rsquo;s truth), feb attempt sexual harrasement many times&hellip; and yes! this needs to be public! girls/women need to stop hiding it and we all need to help them to do so!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>everyone be best friends till something like this happens :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i&rsquo;m not surprised. i only started watching otv content recently and ig its from an outsiders pov, but Fed&rsquo;s constant &ldquo;simping&rdquo; for girls to me seemed like something more and made me quite uncomfortable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Um, sad story and all, but noone is saying a word about the extremely bad valorant plays?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tbh I am verry sad that he got kicked out he was my favourite person in OFTV</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a offlinetv new fan I already love them all as seeing that one left already made me sad but I know is the right thing to do but as a wish for the future of offlinetv and fed to be a great one I want everyone to support fed to change and lily and Yvonne will finally get pass this drama.as a final wish I want all of us to fix 2020 and finally make it a great year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the complete opposite of simping</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>STATE OF SHOCK ? WHY DIDNT THE GIRL TELL HIM TO LEAVE OR SCREAM LIKE THE OTHER ASIAN GIRL DID WHEN HE TRYD TO HUG HER &hellip; THIS SEEMS WIERD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As for my experience with alchohol. (keep in mind i have never drank any) it only increases the bar of what is okay to you. So for example if swearing is below your bar of okayness (dont know how to word that) then getting drunk might make you swear more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bruh, I am hurt&hellip;.. I can&rsquo;t believe this. This is insane to me&hellip; sigh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I genuinely had respect for Fed, but now&hellip; it&rsquo;s just&hellip;. Damn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can&rsquo;t spell offline TV with out the fs :,( feds horny mode took him away from us, and he shall be remembered as many things the slick, the akward, the horny, and most importantly the spice of offlinetv</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>honestly not suprised, he gave me a lot of weird vibes in some streams</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I only made it a minute in&hellip; there is a hole in my heart rip fed😢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That valorant gameplay makes me sick lmao its so bad</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;wah how did i get here?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ahh well I don’t think you understand any of this</p>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>it&rsquo;s a problem if women can&rsquo;t say no, then they are not adults by definition it&rsquo;s possible that that is a female condition then females can&rsquo;t be declared adult or must kept seperate from males permanent, you can&rsquo;t have it both way, etiher you are a full adult functioning humen or not.

<ol start="2">
<li>you say lying on the bed is a bad thing, but why do this women let that happen were so unprofessional to mix up private live and business BY THEM SELF, if they don&rsquo;t want the mixture they have to say no, I am sorry, and if they literally are to weak humans to do so well ask the boyfriend to tell him or whatever.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hey at least he got the most content he’s ever made on his way out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know alcohol effects people in different ways but when I drink I go hard and I can still control myself</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was he literally caught simping</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First of all not even lying fed was my favourite otv group member (before Michael joined) and i just wanna say what he did was wrong really wrong but i just dont think that the girls tried to help him they could have got him a therapist or spoken out the next day it happened and take action immediately i belive this whole situation could have been avoided (keep in mind im not saying fed didnt deserve to get kicked out what he did was wrong and i get what they did) but i belive they could have done something to prevent this much damage on his career and life in general i belive after this incident feds career is over yes i understand he can get better and i hope he does but i just dont think that he can recover from this also in yvonnes statement she said &ldquo;this isnt supposed to destroy fed&rdquo; but to be real it really did he cant recover from this and i think he&rsquo;s streaming days are over (for now at least if he wants to get better he has to take a break from all of social media and just take therapy or something cause something is really wrong it can be fixed but it will take time im not hating on yvonne but what she said about not destorying his career is kinda wrong she knew this would end him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m gonna miss fed so much. F in the chat. I wish he would have had some time to better himself</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wattup anber!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asian women tend to react in that way. And he&rsquo;s a creep for using alcohol as a fall back as he clearly lied first time that he didn&rsquo;t remember and did it again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oof I don’t think fed will ever get laid now&hellip; unless he gets a prostitut</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i like how the video is about Fed and the outro is Fed up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First cryaotic now fed, 2020 is one hell of a year</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clearly those who keeps defending fed does not know how bad it is to be molested. i hope yvoone is emotionally fine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did they ever tell him their reaction to him, like if it was uncomfortable. maybe i missed it in the writing. it just seems obvious to say to him if she considered him as a friend, but i know it can be hard in some circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I guess not having a gf finally got to him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>just saw this vid while searching in youtube what tl;dr is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this is reminding me too much of the japan incident</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>am i the only one who just knew fed isnt a good person for a long time? like i always brushed it off because people seemed to like him but then this, im not surprised</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dammit fed&hellip;.😥 I&rsquo;m gonna miss the fedvonne duo</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I literally just found Offline Tv today. wtf, Although I will say I didn&rsquo;t like fed that much, he seemed like he was trying to be cool in a group full of geeks (geeks are amazing people in my eyes). Like I like all of the others, but I never really liked zed that much</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And people saying that it was made up to be trendy or anything like that.

<p>Multiple times in videos Yvonne constantly talks about how she has it when people randomly walk into her room.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of the time it is about Lily but Fed probably added to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My guy you just changed my point of veiw.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hahahahaha Fed got kicked out lol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best quotes from aristotle: i dont want to destroy him, just end his life forever.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>I dont want to cancel him, just sway everyone on earth to never speek or contact him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bruh Damm fed you should have did that to poki instead of yvonne you still would have gotten kick out but go big or go home right</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi anber!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From this video i learned he is just a stupid person who thinks with instinct and not brain what are those lazy lie i was too easy to get of of those situations just had to stop</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saw this coming years ago, I mean if you are not blinded by your love to their group, you can tell he was the first SIMP ever existed, years ago. I’m shocked that he had the balls to do it tho.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reeeeeee</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>why is everyone suprised didn&rsquo;t hee seem little different compare to the others in that house? creepy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>damn bro when i saw he got kicked out i was like fed why, whyyy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>now theres only 3 reasons why i watch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Toast, Michael and Scarra</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holey crap, Fed pulled a captain Aizen on us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of this shows what a good and caring the OTV community is. And all that was sent out, was with respect of all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In my opinion, he knew what he was doing all along. Albeit he seemed nice and decent as a person, he only blamed alcohol for his &ldquo;memory loss&rdquo; and &ldquo;actions&rdquo;. This behaviour was repeated throughout which makes me think he&rsquo;s that pretend &ldquo;nice guy&rdquo; and borderline psychopath via the manipulations, charming and all, in order to get close to the subject and/or what he desired. I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of him, but this behaviour is extremely unacceptable regardless of the excuse. I do hope he get some help and become a better person from this.</p>

<p>6:15 up her t h a i s</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sounds like he had an alchohol problem and might need to seek counseling for it. You do things that arent yourself when your drunk but that doesnt excuse his actions. I felt if they addressed it earlier before it got out of hand it might have ended better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was searching for a vid where i dont have to read stuff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Big thing to note that Fed is a very touchy person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>thats why you should never drink cuz you dont know whats going to happen when you are drunk and you wont remember it</p>
</li>
