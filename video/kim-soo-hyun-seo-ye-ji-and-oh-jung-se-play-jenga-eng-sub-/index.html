<li>Find out how to win Seo Yea-ji‚Äôs signed drawing of Kim Soo-hyun and Oh Jung-se on our community tab here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugxx9cllMpFvbAULilJ4AaABCQ!">https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugxx9cllMpFvbAULilJ4AaABCQ!</a> üéÅ</li>
<li>I just realized that seo ye ji doesn&rsquo;t talk a lot she&rsquo;s very calm instead kim soo hyun is the opposite of her üòÇ he talks a lottt</li>
<li>So ur telling me he‚Äôs a professional bowler, was in the military, highest paid actor, good looking AND he has a personality?? God really has his favourites</li>
<li>Fun fact: Seo Ye ji is actually an introvert lol.</li>
<li>Oh Jung Se is such a humble person. I heard that the autistic brother of a fan of the show kept saying how much he liked Sang tae and could relate to him. He made a list of all the things he wanted to do with Sang tae and eventually his sister reached out to the actor. He ended up dressing up as Sang tae and acted as him for a whole day when hanging out with the brother. I think they went to a theme park too. ‚ò∫Ô∏è</li>
<li>Let‚Äôs not forget to appreciate Oh Jung-se. He is such a greatt actor, I mean his role as Sangtae is so challenging! Love him‚ù§Ô∏è</li>
<li>Why is nobody talking about her outfit. She‚Äôs wearing the same outfit as in the Kdrama</li>
<li>Everyone be talking bout Yea-ji and Soohyun so imma talk about how good of an actor Jung-se is, like playing the part of a kiddish adult ain&rsquo;t easy although he made it look easy so can we take a moment to appreciate his amazingggg acting skills</li>
<li>I didn‚Äôt expect Kim Soohyun to be this talkative I expected him to be quiet and I thought aseo Yeaji will be the talkative as well as Oh jungse but they‚Äôre just the total opposite haha</li>
<li>Oh Jung Se is simply funny. I guess he&rsquo;s the type of guy who wouldn&rsquo;t attract attention for himself but people still gravitate towards him because he&rsquo;s naturally warm and pleasant. And god, the acting chops! I&rsquo;ve cried in every episode because of his scenes.</li>
<li>The fact that kim soohyun was extremely introvert before and started acting on stage to try to get better at speaking in front of other people. Look at him now, he looks so friendly and humble, it must be nice to be friends with him. Love this trio btw ‚ù§Ô∏è</li>
<li>I hope she wins an award for her role as Go Moon Young, she was very underrated before this role! Watch her performance in the drama &lsquo;Save Me&rsquo;, starring 2pm&rsquo;s Taecyeon and Woo Do Whan! üëèüèª</li>
<li>Oh Jung-Se shoked me. He&rsquo;s such a talented actor. After this character I had to look him online just to be sure that he didn&rsquo;t have autism in real life. He&rsquo;s acting was so damn good, touching and realistic that I couldn&rsquo;t believe it was just that, acting. ü§Øü§Øü§Ø</li>
<li>There are many talented actresses in Korea but tbh i don&rsquo;t think that anybody could play the role of moon young better than seo ye ji&hellip;.if she doesn&rsquo;t get the &lsquo;Korean actress of the year 2020&rsquo; award i am literally not gonna watch any kdrama ever again&hellip;she DESERVES it, every role she has played with such dedication and hard work..she said in this game &lsquo;it&rsquo;s okay to get exhausted or struggle&rsquo; it sounds so heart breaking&hellip;.please vote for seo ye ji for the actress of the year&hellip;you can see the voting process on the instagram account (hyunjicouple) in the highlights&hellip;.you people are praising her so much please try to get her the recognition she so much deserves..</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s actually weird to hear Oh Junse with his normal voice now!!! His acting skills were soooo good!!!!</li>
<li>i&rsquo;m so glad that seo ye ji is receiving a lot of love and recognition these days. i first saw her when she modeled for ivy club alongside exo. she honestly hasn&rsquo;t aged at all! then i watched her in save me, which i have to agree is a character very close to her real personality. and in lawless lawyer, she is a total badass! also, this is my first time watching kim soo hyun in a drama lol yes im one of those snobs who didn&rsquo;t watch my love from the star üòÇ i&rsquo;m surprised that KSH is</li>
<li>&ldquo;Look into the camera for five seconds &quot;</li>
<li>&quot; Oh it&rsquo;s easy &quot;</li>
<li></li>

<li>
<p>Fangirls around the world : Dead , destroyed , melted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kim Soo Hyun is very different from what i imagined. I imagined him as the very serious one, then here&rsquo;s this video. Hahahhaha</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gangtae‚Äôs version of Netflix and Chill: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk‚Äù üëÄüòó</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seo Yeji is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful actress in Korea as well as my favorite one</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kim soo hyun is so charismatic and talkative. He seems like a really fun, nice and sincere person, which apparentely was unexpected for a lot of us. üòÇüòÇ anyways, totally believable that he&rsquo;s the highest paid actor in korea. He&rsquo;s really outstanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why does he look so young!!!?!?? But then his age is 32!!??! He looks like he‚Äôs 24 tf üò©üò©üò©</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hello&hellip; The drama has ended and you give us only Jenga? No other games?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t anyone want to talk about sang tae? He is so polite here, in real life. Respect for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is no one talking about the Netflix and chill part üòÇüòÇüòÇ hes sooo wholesomeeee</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am really gonna miss these three. The acting in this show was gold standard across the board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the fact that soo hyun and yeji&rsquo;s personality are complete opposites makes them even more cuter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In real life KSH is such a bright, humorous,playful and extra person while in dramas, movies he&rsquo;s The King of tears. How talented he is!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don‚Äôt need a boyfriend. I want SYJ and KSH to date IRL JEBALLLLL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when she actually made a cute face but was so embarrassed and automatically when to kim soo hyun and hid behind him üòè</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No ones gonna talk about how KSH described SYJ as color red, that means he is attracted to her, yasss my ship is sailing</p>
</li>

<p>As a highest paid actor in southkorea he is so down to earth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dear swoon, please make them do the couch talk and compliment me episode. Please do something as a gift to the fans of this drama. There are a lot of us waiting for the interaction of this couple. üòç You make it possible to other dramas and this drama which is very succesful and we only get the jenga game. üò¢üò§

<p>Seo Ye-ji is such a girl crush. &ldquo;That sounded very sad and heartbreaking.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Literally no one :</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Kim soo hyun:*stealing peices of the jenga. ü§£</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The way this is supposed to be an individual competition but Kim Soo hyun and see yeji is acting like they are a group ! Poor sang tae</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone, the highest paid actor in Korea is stealing jenga pieces right infront of your eyes. üòÇüòÇüòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you can see they&rsquo;re great actors when there character does not math their personality at all:)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anyone here to watch all these videos of the cast after watching the last episode because you just feel empty after finishing the drama</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first thing that made me want to watch It‚Äôs Okay Not To Be Okay is because of Kim Soo Hyun. But I ended up loving Seo Ye Ji a lot more üíû</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>its her voice n her character in the drama that got me hooked. n of course the story itself i think is well written.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The way Yeji letting Soohyun decide for her what netflix mission she should choose üòª so adorable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who&rsquo;s here bc they can&rsquo;t recover from EP14 and needs a happy pill?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did anyone notice the little pout from SYJ when KSH described her as ‚Äúred‚Äù üò¨ love the trio üíïüíï</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know KSH is this talkative and playful. üòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Am i the only one who loves the chemistry of Kim soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WE NEED MORE KIM SOOHYUN X SEO YEA JI CONTENTS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The translation is wrong. Oh jung sae didnt say that sang tae is &ldquo;innocent child&rdquo; he said Sang Tae is &ldquo;innocent friend&rdquo; and &ldquo;friend&rdquo; means just a &ldquo;person&rdquo; (very different nuance compared to &ldquo;kid&rdquo;) in Korean. The whole drama focuses delicately as in lines not to show autistic ppl as &ldquo;kids&rdquo; but just &ldquo;different adults&rdquo; (ex. Sang tae being angry and assertive to others saying that &ldquo;I am not a kid&rdquo; and Sang tae trying to be a trustworthy and strong adult taking care of MY and KT, Oh Jung sae even interviewed that the drama receives feedback from parents of autistic people. One mom said that the scene where Soon Duk made a rabbit? Fox? I forgot but some animal in vegetable for Sang Tae is a bit offensive because autistic person is portrayed as a kid so Oh Jung sae wanted to embrace the feedback from the mom therefore said in his lines as ad lib &ldquo;Sang Tae is not a child&rdquo; to Sun Duk to refuse the vegetable doll. And the line was not on the original script) so the translation like this should be more careful.</p>

<p>THE FACT THAT THEY ONLY GAVE US ONE &ldquo;HI SWOONIES&rdquo; VIDEO and it got 3MILLION Views in 2 weeks!!!!! IOTNBO nation power!!!</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Now pls give us compliment me and couch talk JEBAL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Kim Soo-hyun overreacted to &ldquo;Wanna watch Netflix with me?&rdquo; I lost it. Lmaooo</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s thinking about the &ldquo;Netflix &amp; chill&rdquo; term. I can&rsquo;t üòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I cannot believe kim soo hyun is the same guy who plays a variety of all these characters and pulls off such serious emotions and feelings so perfectly when he is the BIGGEST dork out there. I love him so much</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ye ji looks like an 18 year old girl when her hair is laid back down</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kim Soo Hyun is so funny actually. I&rsquo;m waiting for him to play a comedy romance drama.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is no one talking about soo hyun keeping blocks in his bag</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They‚Äôre the absolute opposite of the characters they play lmao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I got so used with Oh Jung-Se playing an autistic character that I first got weirded out with how he‚Äôs acting here. He really deserves the best supporting actor award.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seo Yea-Ji has got to be the most beautiful Korean actress! I love everything about her specially her voice!! Would love to see her work with Lee Min-Ho!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people dont talk enough about Oh jung-se amazing work in the series .I&rsquo;ve never gotten so attached to a character knowing its not real.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>why is no one talking about how yeji asks soohyun what sticker to choose üò≠

</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s so cute how SYJ hid behind KSH after she tried to make an emoji face LOL</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>I was really amazed by Oh jung se, how he played the character sang tae. That was sooooo good soooo good. It was really difficult to see him as a normal person in this vdoüòÇ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seo yaeji is such a charismatic girl , she has an amazing aura .. and her deep voice .. IM MELTIIINGG</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we can&rsquo;t have another content, can we atleast have the uncut version of this? PLEASE!? THANK YOU SO MUCH!?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gang-tae: really serious</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Kim Soo Hyun: literally laughs at anything</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i just noticed how yeji and soohyun played eachother‚Äôs personalities in the drama</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seo Yea-ji is just so pretty it&rsquo;s unbelievable and that outfit like damn she rocks itüíúüíúüíú‚ú®</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kim soohyun is actually an adorable crackhead type, I realised it when I watched him in running man üòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lets be honest, this is not the first time we watched this. Hello Swoon??? Are you still there?? WE NEED MORE OF THIS!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep coming back cause this is the only content you guys be giving us since the drama started airing till 1 week left. What happen? Where is couch talk? Compliment me?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s so weird seeing Jungse out of his Sangtae character. He really fooled my brain into thinking that the character&rsquo;s really him. He&rsquo;s such a great actor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also love how different soohyun and yeaji are in comparison to the characterd they both portray in the drama.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúLook into the camera for 5 seconds‚Äù                 Me while looking at him:üëÅüëÑüëÅ</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>netflix don&rsquo;t see this drama popular? why is the duration only 7 minutes? Their chemistry is very good, please help make it over 10 minutes later

<p>Am i the only one who is finding very uncomfortable with Sang tae oppa üòÖüòÖi&rsquo;m not yet used to it.‚ò∫ Got me?üòÅ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The best actor ever‚ù£</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the amount of likes this comment gets is how many people think all 3 of them are really good actors especially ‚Äúsang tae‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh Jung Se deserves prizes for his acting in this drama</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kim soo hyun is actually a talkative and fun to be around üòÇ. I love him. I‚Äôm surprised yeoji is an introvert ü•∫üíúüíú</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kim So Hyun: NETFLIX AND CHILL? ü§Øüò≥‚ò∫Ô∏è Staff: NO, WE MEANT IT LITERALLY Kim So Hyun: i guess, I OVERREACTEDüëÅüëÑüëÅ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i hope the swoon release uncut full version of this. i‚Äôm curious how soohyun ended up being yeji‚Äôs mission decider ü§îü§î</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only few days after this drama left us. I&rsquo;ve feeling empty all day. I miss them soo much, it&rsquo;s sad that there&rsquo;s no couch talk or any interview about them again especially from TvN and GM. Even it just a photoshoot together again. I miss them, really, so freaking bad. I miss soo hyun&rsquo;s spamming my timeline with his random photos errday in this past 2 months. If i came here one day to see my comments. The reason is always the same, i miss them. I hope they being real couple even it&rsquo;s gonna be secretly. I wanna they dating secretly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How sweet is Yea Ji to offer her gift! &lt;3 She even said it was heavy just so he&rsquo;d take it, but you can tell she really wanted to give it to him in the first place. &lt;3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well, no matter how close Soo Hyun and Ye Ji, I&rsquo;m still wondering why Soo Hyun have to choose all the numbers for her. And what on earth she obeys whatever he said lol. TVN gave so few bts and even the short clips of IONTB in their youtube channel. The BTS also not well-edited. They cut here and there randomly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only bad thing about the video was it&rsquo;s to short, we want mooooreeeee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wonder why you guys didn&rsquo;t notice when seo yea ji said she recommends to read The honest woodcutter. The moral of the story is be honest. Honesty is always rewarded. It talks lot about her personality and I guess it does have something to do with the last episodes too</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Am I the only one who had a five second heart attack when Kim Soo Hyun stared into the camera</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how Seo Yeji is always calm and collected meanwhile Kim Soohyun is goofy and talkative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s so weird seeing Kim Soo Hyun so cheerful and talkative. I&rsquo;m still in Gang Tae mode, I guess. üòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we need an uncut version of this like you did for some other ones!!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon streaming in Netflix just saw this! ‚Äúthe title caught my eyes‚Äú first time watching Korean drama series ever in my life! but the main characters Kim Soo Hyun &amp; Seo Ye-Ji  &amp; their chemistry was superb, the dynamics of their acting was so immensely beautiful they do look so attractively stunning in every angle of their portrayals. The director &amp; all the screws and staffs of this show had a brilliant minds. The show in totality was a healing in heart &amp; human minds.Thank you for  this awesome tv series hope to watch this two (Kim &amp; Seo) again soon in Netflix it made me a fan of them watching from üá¨üáß</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Internet exploded when Seo Yeji and Kim Soohyun kissed.. We all will die when they have a bed scene..

<p>Jung se really made me believe that he has an autistic disorder in real life like seriously that&rsquo;s how good he is at acting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are all great actors! But Oh Jung-se was incredibly convincing and moving in his role as Sangtae. Moved me to tears so many times I lost count</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so cute that Ye Ji lets Kim Soo Hyun decide on what sticker should be picked üëâüëàüò´</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I cant believe we only got jenga???? I need compliment me or couch talk any thing pls cure this withdrawal im having  after the drama endedüò≠üò≠üò≠</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I haven‚Äôt really watched other of her shows but her character and acting in it‚Äôs okay not to be okay WAS ON POINT , I literally fall in love with her character</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it just me or does it make you feel warm and fuzzy whenever Gang-tae calls Sang-tae &ldquo;hyung&rdquo; in a calm and caring tone? üò≠üò≠ And also now when Mun-yeong calls Sang-tae &ldquo;oppa&rdquo; in a patient voice. üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è I&rsquo;m going to miss the chemistry these three have when IOTNBO is over. I have no idea how many times I&rsquo;ve watched this video and it always brings a smile to my face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>KSH actually talkative person LOL, he&rsquo;s so cute</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Woah ! Seeing kim so hyun talking feels so good unlike his drama&rsquo;s where he always play the role of kinda introvert person.‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§Oppa üòÖ p.s I hate the give away gifts by swoon, coz I never win üòë</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it&rsquo;s only 5 days of release and this got 2M&hellip; the power of IOTNBO holds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who knew I‚Äôm going to be so invested in other people playing jenga lol but here we are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>was i the only one who noticed that soo hyun wanted to touch ye ji but didn‚Äôt (because of the camera‚Äôs prob) @ 1:33 &amp; 5:53 ;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a highest paid actor in southkorea he is so down to earth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who&rsquo;s here after watching the last episode????</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚¨áÔ∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh Jung se deserves to win an Oscar for his role ..CAUSE THE MAN BODIED THAT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>can we talk about how SYJ always asked to KSH about the number she should choose for sticker missions? it&rsquo;s cutee</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>coming back here for the 55th time because i can&rsquo;t get over the drama&rsquo;s finale and swoon hasn&rsquo;t uploaded anything new for this drama :'(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where‚Äôs the Coach Talk ? Damn, poor promotion of a beautiful drama. üò≠ We want more contents please! üôèüèªüôèüèª</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Swoon, no more other content? T_T please release if there‚Äôs more. I miss them so bad. Where‚Äôs the other content? I hope there‚Äôs more. But if none, please let us know so we can cry in one corner and slowly move on (if we can). T_T</p>

<li>
<p>The way Yeji hid behind Soohyun when she got embarrassed&hellip;it&rsquo;s too cute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kim Soo Hyun is as high as a kite here. He is very chatty and excitable. So different from his character.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is no one talking about her eye smile üò≥‚ù§Ô∏èüëÑ‚ù§Ô∏èü§©</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I watched Oh Jung-we on The Good Detective, he acted as a very evil man in the show and I really hated his character. Now I am watching him on It‚Äôs ok not to be ok as a artistic man. I must say he acted both shows really well</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh Jung He MY FAVORITE CO STAR OF ALL TIME. His work playing Sangtae is really exhausting but he did it beautifully</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how Kim Soo Hyun doesn‚Äôt try to act cool or act quiet like. Most people act like that when they are top actors. Despite Kim Soo Hyun being the top paid actor in Korea, he doesn‚Äôt act snobby and is very friendly and funny.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do i feel that theyre dating already haha cmon kim soo hyun and seo yea ji you should date for real dont be afraid just tells us we would love it very much if you guys are dating üòçüòçüòçüòçor get married now we would love it totally üòÇüòÇüòÇüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5:58 when she did it again. She‚Äôs so funny hahaha</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PLEASE ANOTHER CONTENT WITH THEM WE NEED MORE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Netflix and chill killed me.  He‚Äôs still a man after allüòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow seo ye ji fame is rising. I&rsquo;m glad people are not sleeping on her. She&rsquo;s a great actress. Most of her videos views are rising too. Ex her appearance in big bang mv let&rsquo;s not fall in love and also the show knowing brothers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the first time I&rsquo;ve seen Kim Soo Hyun off screen. It turns out he&rsquo;s so funny I love him‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really missed this trio, IONTBO will be the best drama for me so far 11/10 or it should be 100/10. I am rooting for this drama to bag all awards specially to the actor Oh Jung-se, I am your fan now OJS, KSH and SYJ has a good chemistry. For KSH, this is your best drama so far</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>6:32 if Kim soo Hyun saw me like that I&rsquo;d faint. I&rsquo;m already dieing here</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I never noticed he was so goodlooking lmao HOW DID I NOT NOTICE?! Not just attractive but literally BEAUTIFUL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one:</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Me: smiling like an idiot from start to end of this vid</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ohhh i like this kim soo hyun he has changed a lot for good. He is more confident and being himself and enjoying . üòçüòç</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ye ji always ask to kim soo hyun opinion to determine the choice of jenga mission and it looks very sweet, really love them

<p>Kim Soohyun: ‚Äú&hellip;Netflix and chill?!!! &hellip;.NETFLIX AND CHILL?!!!!!!‚Äù Hhahahahahahhahahahaha</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that ko munyeong is so soft in real life hahaha</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This drama was really perfect. üëç If I could rate it would be a 10/10. üòò</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the actors were excellent. OST too.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>And I really got attached to the role Oh Jeong Se was playing, I wanted to hug him all the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seo Yeji has such a classy face and surprisingly shy but honest personality. Such a rare gem in k-industry üòç</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>KIM SO SO IS SO TALKATIVE OMGGGG ,I would have never imagine üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇlove him for that</p>

<li>
<p>KIM SOO HYUN being shocked with the NETFLIX and CHILL thing is so funny üòÇ                               Edit: Thanks for the likes guys üòä</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was my first Kdrama and I am obsessed! Their characters were all so complicated and intense that I was so curious to see what they were like in real life and oh boy. I love all three of them so much. I really hope there is a second season!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of Kim Soo Hyun&rsquo;s roles are stiff and don&rsquo;t talk a lot which makes it really refreshing to see him loosen up and be playful in this interview. Thanks Swoon!</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Also, super loved his character in this drama cos he had a chance to grow and show more emotions being Gang Tae who has a great character set-up and development. I will miss this lovable trio! ü§ßüíï</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it was a square, but it was a pentagon&rdquo; i don&rsquo;t know why that was so funny üòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i just watched ‚Äúreal‚Äù and i can‚Äôt look at Gang-tae the same way&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s wierd seeing sang-tae not acting like a child üòÇüòÇüòÇhe&rsquo;s acting skiils are amazing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seo Yeji and her goal waist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you. Watching Kim Soo Hyun being dorky and playful will hold me over until episode 13.

<p>Lmao yall notice how talkative and lively soo hyun is? Definitely opposite of his character, and im lowkey scared of how ye ji is so calm like her character üòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just watched save me cause I‚Äôm absolutely obsessed with seo yeji&hellip; I watched it in one sitting.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Only got three hours of sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes i forget that Kim Soohyun&rsquo;s actual character is the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of all the drama characters he plays..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üòÇüòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just realized that Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji is definitely opposite from each other</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>seo ye ji mentioned in a previous interview that she gets really into her character while filming and that comes off a lot during interviews, so naturally she seems more calm than energetic (like in knowing brothers) while playing ko moon young - shows how great her acting skills are :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôm just here for the apple of my eye Kim soo hyun.ü•∫ü•∫ü§©</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When seo yea ji kept asking which one to choose from kim soo hyun, safety pin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SYJ: There is a sticker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>KSH: No, there isn&rsquo;t.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SYJ: using cute voice Yes, there is. smiling so cute</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>kim soohyun is such a crackhead irl lmaoooo</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For some reason my favourite was always Oh Jung-se since his acting felt so real and the portrayal of his character was amazing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can we have a last interview with them the swoon? To wrap up all thingsüò≠ i kinda sad since it will end soonüò≠</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5:47 I watched that part too many times. But I mean&hellip;.she is so cuteeee</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Literally no one:</p>

<p>Kim soo hyun : instead of being the highest paid actor, stealing jenga blocksü§£ü§£ü§£

</li>
<li>
<p>My heart is so full seeing the three of them together üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è Our troublemaker trio. A happy family. Thank you for the fun, touching, and heartwarming ride, IOTNBO. I&rsquo;m already missing this drama so much after watching the final episode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôm still getting use to Oh Jung Se without autism ü•∫üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>I love how chill Seo Yeji is w them and how she can just act normal and lean on them ‚ù§Ô∏èüòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard seeing sang-tae speaking casually and not stuttering at all haha i got used to his personality or character at IONTBO</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Her voice is so special&hellip;. really suits thriller</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>kim soo hyun&rsquo;s real personality is sooo different from most of the characters he plays, it&rsquo;s so refreshing xD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazing cast with such great talent. Really impressed by the show as a beginner to Hallyu and Korean shows.</p>
</li>

<p>swoon we are still hoping for the compliment me and the couch talk :((( pls
