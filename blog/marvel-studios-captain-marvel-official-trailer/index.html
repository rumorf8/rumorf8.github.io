<p>I don&rsquo;t care what anybody says; as a woman, this movie made me feel empowered. I love it. It may not be Marvel&rsquo;s strongest, but it is one of my favorites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She saved our legend from space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who&rsquo;s watching Captain Marvel trailer after Black Widow teaser?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She punched the grandma in the head, Thanos killer confirmed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not the best MCU film, however she grew on me by the end of the movie. Only gripes are they only show her past through flashbacks that are way too brief. I would of love to see her past more fleshed out. That and they underutilized the Kree and Skrulls. Besides that I give it a 7/10. Her and Nick Fury have good chemistry and I love the Stan Lee cameo. It made me smile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who came after watching the Black Widow trailer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember when everyone complained that Brie Larson didn’t show enough emotion in the trailer? How did no one realize that Brie was basically getting told to smile? Do you people not know what that means, like, at all?</p>

<p>“Discover what makes her a hero”

</li>
<li>
<p>Now I know</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Legend has it that Drax is in this trailer, but we can’t see him because he is standing so still.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breathtaking special effects! The de-aging of Samuel L Jackson is worth the ticket price alone!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who’s here after watching the movie?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t live with the trauma of the ending of the era.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Where did that bring you?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The movie was 2 hours long but for me it felt like 10 minutes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>50 Million people watched the trailer so that means the old lady got punched 50 Million times</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for the likes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marvel: This is our first female superhero movie!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Electra: Am I a joke to you?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I liked the movie,  can&rsquo;t wait for black widow,  I think it&rsquo;s going to be great</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The way Fury loses his eye is hilarious 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I watched this movie 2x and it&rsquo;s really good! I became a fan right away hahaha!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For those of you who haven&rsquo;t seen this film you better watch it first. It has tons of comedy there and you get to know CM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As for brie&rsquo;s remarks, I think it was intentional and she may have been instructed to spark such controversy because haters will still give review and will spark curiosity and free publicity and promotion of the film. And that, I think is what made it successful.

<p>“How will people know that this is in the past?” “BLOCKBUSTER!”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how they fooled us into thinking Jude Law was playing Mar-Vell in this trailer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fury: Last time I trusted someone, I lost an eye</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cap: Oh yeah&hellip;hehe&hellip;I heard about the cat&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fury: Shut the hell up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>captain marvel is awesome ;i lve this movie its so awesome</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seeing this film in theatres is an experience I will never forget. I was so excited to watch the trailer back when it came out, and I still love this movie. This film is incredible, and the feeling of female empowerment leaves an incredible mark for young girls everywhere. I wish we had more flashbacks to young Carol, but the scene of her younger selves getting up as she&rsquo;s fighting to get control of her powers might be one of my favorite scenes the MCU has ever done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So get this, Marvel can make Sam Jackson look like he’s 40 again, but DC can’t even remove a mustache?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the movie was much better than the trailer for a change. 👍.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This film&rsquo;s musics made by Pınar Toprak, Congratulations 🌼</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like the trailers for this movie kinda sucked but the film itself was great!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why does everybody hates cap marvel!?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Real question btw</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to make sure people know the movie takes place in the past: put blockbuster in the first scene</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ready to see another female focused marvel movie, I enjoyed captain marvel so I’m definitely looking forward to black widow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This trailer is perfect to me!!! But it’s too bad that I didn’t like this movie as much I loved this first trailer. 🤷🏾‍♂️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Captain Carol 🔥</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I remember watching this backstage during my schools fall play, and getting yelled at for screaming cause I was so excited</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can we let people know this takes place in the past?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show an operating Blockbuster

<p>A refreshing film featuring, I know, I know, a FEMALE lead!! 🤗 Truly a mesmerizing film, I couldn&rsquo;t take my eyes off the screen. A deep storyline beautifully played out. I loved that they didn&rsquo;t sexualize her either &ndash; she didn&rsquo;t have to prove herself, for she already knew who she was! A strong, capable woman inspiring us to be the best version of ourselves. I would love to see a sequel! 💯😁</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Species: human male</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Threat : low to none.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fury: that thing&rsquo;s clearly busted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Captain Marvel is my favorite hero after Spiderman 😍</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I lllllllllllllllllllllllllooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooovvvvvvvveee captain marvel!!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That shot of her punching a grandma is gonna be a meme, calling it now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>anyone remembers Blockbuster? then you are old.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just watched it. It&rsquo;s not perfect but I still wanted to see more of her. So awesome. Forget the haters because haters gonna hate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I loved this movie so much, but some people had a problem with it because her final battles were won too easily. There was not much of a challenge. In her second film, she will have to be put up against a problem she can&rsquo;t deal with on her own, it opens up many opportunities for changes in character development. In truth, I think her second movie is going to be outstanding 👌</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An alien who uses phrases like &ldquo;steal your thunder&rdquo;&hellip;.yeah right 🙄</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disney: “How can we make the audience believe Captain Marvel is set in the 90s?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Director: “Pan the camera at a Blockbuster”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Higher. Further. Faster&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I heard the same words but in a different platform 😅😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What a great movie but watch until after the credits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wanna see what they say when black widow destroys this in sales</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was awesome! Definenly will watch again and so inspiring of a powerful hero such as Captain marvel! Her powers are amazing and epic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Discover what makes her a hero” immediately punches old woman in the face

<li>
<p>wtf first time I see this trailer lol&hellip;the other than with the &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not gonna fight your war, I&rsquo;m gonna end it&rdquo; is better though</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Congrats&hellip; the film just went back to number 1 last thursday, 2 months after its release and 1 day prior to the release of endgame&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>12:50 PM 5/11/2020  You know I wasnt in the Airforce.  Theres a couple &ldquo;dejavu&rdquo; scenes in this one.  I already did that questionaire outloud if I was a super hero who would I be.  Its US Agent (depends on mood Im in).  You should put her in here with me in the movies.  I dont know what she looks like but I keep hearing a female name if thats really her.  Shes my lawyer now?  The dejavu scenes?  I was the one talking about True Lies.  What happened to her how she forgot who she was kind of like brainwashing happened to me (flashbacks and what she took part in that was confidential in Airforce).  The scenes when she hasnt seen her friends in a long time the conversations I related to is me?  Its not obvious in the movie but you have to be a comic nerd to know this&hellip; the blue skinned alien race was given but not obvious in the story in movie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why am I getting all these Marvel Trailers in my recommended that don’t even seem like a day old but somehow are one year old?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Carol, how&rsquo;d you know that old lady was a skrull?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a skrull?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish I could’ve seen Captain Marvel she was filming 2 hours away from my house</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My least favorite part of this movie was when captain marvel was on screen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maaaan, this movie made me so inspired. And her power level is incredible 😍</p>
</li>

<p>Just what we need, someone to deal with those pesky old ladies on public transports.</p>
</li>

<p>&ldquo;The original Captain Marvel first goes by the name Mar-Vell and comes from an alien race called the Kree. Under the identity of a dead pilot named Walter Lawson, he becomes close with a NASA employee named Carol Danvers, who has an impressive résumé as a former Air Force officer, fighter pilot, and CIA agent. On Earth, he publicly defeats an enemy robot, and people begin calling him Captain Marvel. When a device called the Psyche-Magnetron explodes in the presence of Mar-Vell and Danvers, the latter absorbs the alien superhero&rsquo;s DNA and gains superpowers as a human and Kree hybrid. Danvers originally uses the title Ms. Marvel, but the comic company eventually renamed her Captain Marvel in 2012.&rdquo;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Cat : miaw 😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So just watched this. What a terrible pos. Id rather wash dishes and spend hours in pointless dialogue like this movie. Dullsville. The best part was at end credits when the Cat puked up the tesserac.  Just like a cat lol. The rest of the movie is  nonsensical diatribe.</p>

<p>Even tho it didnt show at the end the green &ldquo;things&rdquo; had the same jacket I have so my jacket famous</p>

<li>
<p>The movie is way better than the trailer makes it out to be</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m not ready for &quot; In memory of Stan Lee&quot; in the end credit scene.😢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is objectively awesome that Nick Fury has a soft spot for kitties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After seeing infinity war this movie helped me to move on from thanos' snap.Captain marvel is so powerful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Huh.  I just watched the new Batwoman trailer.  That was ridiculous looking, but it got me wondering about Captain Marvel.  I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d seen the Captain Marvel trailer, but I have to say it actually looks pretty good.  Seems to me the difference is that this new Batwoman is pretty much characterized by her womanhood.  Captain Marvel on the other hand is more about her being a superhero, rather than being a woman.  Captain Marvel may have done well, but I&rsquo;m thinking Batwoman won&rsquo;t be nearly as successful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m hella late but I&rsquo;m still going to see this 💣💥</p>

<p>I like how it sets the time period by having her crash in a blockbuster</p>
</li>

<p>I remember when everyone thought she would have the ability to Time Travel</p>

<p>Hey Thanos, you remember when you snapped your finger to erase half of the universe</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>They just had to change the character&rsquo;s gender.  After many successful comic years. How&rsquo;d that work out for ya.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if it had been a badass character like Milla Jovovich instead of an instagramceleb-like massproduct whose name will be forgotten in 2 weeks.

<li>
<p>I watched all MCU movies still watching their trailors, lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WHERE WAS THE FLURKIN IN THIS TRAILER!?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great Movie! i love it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WOWWWW so glad I didn&rsquo;t watch the trailer beforehand. Combination of super important spoilery parts and then the dull parts smushed together. Watched it for a second time recently and appreciated it much more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanos: You should have gone for the head&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Captain Marvel: punches old lady in the head</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanos: I meant my head, but this&hellip; does put a smile on my face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who came here yo see it for any further Avengers hope,that they are alive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After watching the infinity war.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like the godzilla vs kong trailer 1 gonna be realised around september cause it comes out on March and also captian marvel was realised on march so maybe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HIGHW4Y!! To the: YURI ZONE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>holy moley she can go into a avatar state on steriods ? 1:49</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DISCOVER WHAT MAKES A HERO&hellip; &ldquo;punches old lady on bus.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fun fact: there is no CGI in the movie, it is just Brie Larson</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stan Lee&rsquo;s montage in the Marvel Studios Logo opening was touching. It made me pause the movie and pull out some Silver Age favorites from my collection and smile, but later I thought, Kirby should have gotten one of those in Endgame.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>who’s here after watching the movie ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>old lady: smiles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>captain marvel: 1:31</p>

<p>how to show this movie is in the past: show a blockbuster store

<p>I fell like she&rsquo;s not gonna fit in the next avengers movie. When she stands next to Scarlet it would look &amp; sound like she is the weaker one. Her portrayal feels likes a teenager on puberty. I thought she&rsquo;d be like black widow at least, she is a trained warrior after all. But the other casts did their characters justice, just not her. Maybe coz I&rsquo;ve seen wonder woman so my standard is high? &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not gonna fight your war, I&rsquo;m gonna end it&rdquo;. go find a teenager girl &amp; make her say this line. It sound exactly the same!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dude I swear the old lady who get Larsoned at 1:31 looks like an elderly Elizabeth Olsen!</p>

<p>Who here LOOOVES captain marvel?! :D</p>

<li>
<p>“Discover what makes her a hero” cuts to captain marvel punching an old lady</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I loved the movie and the soundtrack of this TRAILER!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Film is good to watch once maybe two times,  and that is that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Funny how the upcoming &ldquo;Batwoman&rdquo; series is trying a similar approach to its marketing with the &ldquo;The Hero&rdquo;&hellip;&ldquo;Is Here&rdquo; and then fades into &ldquo;Her&rdquo;. Looking at it first used here, it really doesn&rsquo;t bother me much, because it fades from &ldquo;Her&rdquo; to &ldquo;A Hero&rdquo;, so it doesn&rsquo;t feel too political in a way. &ldquo;Batwoman&rdquo; is just pushing the female political agenda to new heights with its marketing imo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heck yes I watch this movie</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanos: You should have gone for the head&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Captain Marvel: punches old lady in the head</p>

<p>The old lady she punched was Thanos' granny. That&rsquo;s what started this whole mess.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fury was just a dark character until someone affected him and it was a damm cat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love the music in the trailer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You&rsquo;re favorite part in the trailer 1:48</p>

<li>
<p>i don&rsquo;t care what people say &hellip;..i am absolutely in love with captain marvel &hellip;.my new favorite super HERo</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who’s here from Black Widow trailer?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that Marvel is using blockbuster to illustrate that this movie takes place a long time ago makes me feel both old and sad that other people will never experience blockbuster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the one of the best trailers out there. I literally come back to it every other week to re-watch it. Magnificent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought the movie was better than a lot of people gave it credit for</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can you make the origin of this character into such a bland movie? No tone of it&rsquo;s own or a compelling main character. Just&hellip; Meh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Captain marvel was not from here she came from the &lsquo;Room&rsquo; 😁</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i was doubting the trailer until she punched the old lady</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who is here after watching the Wonder woman trailer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m just interested in knowing more about Nick furry&rsquo;s character

<p>Me who haven’t watched this movie: oh my GOSH she punched an elder lady</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I actually came back here after watching the Wonder Women 1984 trailer and Ill have to say the other trailer looks a hell of a lot better in terms of emotions, likability, story, and acting. Maybe the special effects on this movie is better but that&rsquo;s it. Wonder woman is actually allowed to love a man.</p>
