<li>
<p>Who is with me in 2020 listening moon lover ost</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe I have finally moved on from this drama after more than 3 years. ❤ After watching IU on her latest drama, &ldquo;Hotel Del Luna&rdquo;, I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about her &ldquo;Scarlet Heart&rdquo; drama in 2016. It was the drama that made me yearn for something that I never had. It made my heart broken for someone I&rsquo;ve never met. It was the drama that made me hate and gave me dreams of my non-existent ex. 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this is one of the most unforgettable dramas in the history</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s so sad but I just realised that not only did the characters lose their lives but also their love.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Myung hee died after learning her husband loves another girl.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Court lady Oh died and never got to love the king openly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The king died after losing his love.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the saddest drama I ever watched. Everyone like literally, everyone died in the end and I couldn’t sleep the whole night because of that drama. It is still bothering me until now. I wish there was a season 2 for this drama.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Season 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Who&rsquo;s still waiting?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>👇🏻</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I literally cried for one hour straight when I watched Eun and his wife die they were so innocent and loving and cheerful they didnt deserve to die and Eun remained loyal to hus wife TO THE VERY LAST SECOND despite it being common for husbands to fall out of love and leave their wives at that point in history</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It just shows how much of an angel Eun and his wife are and urghhhh why must they die

<p>2020 and Im still waiting Scarlet Heart Season 2 ;-;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C&rsquo;mon, I really think that everyone (literally everyone) love Scarlet Heart Ryeo. I really don&rsquo;t get it why this drama had a low rating in Korea but hell yeah it was so overrated overseas. I would love to watch this again since it&rsquo;s quarantine. Stay at home people!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the disadvantage for us people that is hopeless romantic, we ask for season 2 because this kdrama is so tragic, very painful, full of sadness.. this drama leaves me with lots of questions,  Lots of whys.. why they didn&rsquo;t end together, does she meet 4th prince Wang-So  in the future? What happen to their daughter.. my God please give us season2. Answer all the what and whys of the fans😭😭😭😭😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>its so weird. when i listening to each song i totally can remember scene that happens with that song.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>and my mood change only 0.003 lmao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy that I can still remember the scenes while listening to these songs, it hurts as hell too. My heart is still broken :( Can&rsquo;t move on. 2020 and I&rsquo;m still amazed with the story, I even researched the history of Goryeo, and Gwangjong. I wish there will be season 2. Still hoping 🙏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fun Fact: Eun died because Baekhyun’s schedule was too busy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scarlet Heart Ryeo will always be the BEST Historical, Tragic Love in HISTORY</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s the sad ending.. oopss.. i mean the tragic ending that makes this kdrama unforgettable one.. happy ending makes us satisfied but then easily forget and move on to another, but the tragic one will linger even after 3 years&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This series is so good it even made me want to learn about korean history.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Listening Scarlet heart ost while reading all the comment sections hit me different😭.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yah, the drama is like 4 years ago. This OST is posted 8 months ago and still got over 2 million views. People are thirsty for Season 2!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For people who keeps thinking why this drama didn’t do well in Korea, the reason behind it is that this drama was a korean remake of the chinese drama “Bu Bu Jing Xin” and the whole drama was actually aimed mostly at the international market, more specifically, the chinese market. Believe it or not the drama was a huge success in China and other international market. So whilst it wasn’t as successful in it’s home country, it did do well internationally and thus the drama achieved what it aimed for overall. So let’s not be sad about how it didn’t do well because it did :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can’t stop thinking how Wang So live his life after Hae Soo’s death huhuhuhu. Can’t imagine how alone he is😭 Yet Kang HaNeul will still my bias wrecker in the drama</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yang 2020 masih suka sama ost moon lovers ❣️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it&rsquo;s been  4 hours since i&rsquo;ve watched this but my heart aches until now. i can&rsquo;t stop crying. i miss them already : (((</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>I can’t stop crying😭😭😭😭😭😭 moon lovers❤️😭 scarlet heart will always be my favorite drama everrr❤️❤️❤️</p>
</li>

<p>Every couple in Scarlet Heart deserves a happy ending especially Hae Soo and Wang So but all of them didn’t end up together :(

</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s so heart brokening and I cried when baekhyun die.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It my favourite drama I always watch 😘😘😍😍♥️♥️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2020 and the pain is still there 💔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it still hurts, i can&rsquo;t even watch any other dramas because of this, why does it hurts so muchhh? everytime that i listen to this songs it really breaks my heart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They kept on asking me. Why moon lovers hooked my heart. The only answer is, I saw how the 4th prince showered his love to hae soo. I want that kind of love. He just sacrificed everything for her. He gives all of him to her even if hae soo didn&rsquo;t ask for it. I hope in this day, all men will realize and appreciates their woman&rsquo;s worth. Just don&rsquo;t take her for granted. Be her shield no matter what happen. Be a man not a guy. I think being a man is sweeter than being a guy. Take note of this.❤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Still waiting for season 2😭</p>

<p>This dram is so good. All the cast members of this drama played their characters very naturally. But true this drama has left many questions. . Really hope for the saeson 2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God I love this drama so much and forever will. I have never cried so hysterically in my entire life. So and Soo will forever be in my life and heart.</p>
</li>

<p>Just done watching Scarlet Heart today. Idk how long can I get over with this heartbreak💔 I love all the osts and that&rsquo;s the reason why I am here listening to all of them over and over again. I feel like crying while listening to these songs. I need season 2!!!😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After watching this drama last 2017, I cannot find other drama that is so heartbreaking than this. I just had finished watching this for the 2nd time. Still hoping for the part 2.. So in love with Lee Joon Gi and IU!😍😍</p>
