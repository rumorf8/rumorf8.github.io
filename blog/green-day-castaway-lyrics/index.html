<p>Warning gets so overlooked, and it probably has some of Green Day&rsquo;s best material</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think Green Day wrote some really awesome songs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the best songs off of Warning along with Minority and Macy&rsquo;s Day Parade</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aggghhhh, sometimes I feel bad that i was born too late to enjoy green day. Now theyre older and they arent as popular as they once were D: but at least i still have their older music to appreciate, i just wish i wasnt born this late.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With all respect, French people can&rsquo;t avoid hearing &ldquo;cassoulet&rdquo; &ndash;' Sorry Billie Joe!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I swear Green Day&rsquo;s obsessed with boulevard&rsquo;s! xD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>green day is too awesome. they are my favorite band, but they havent been for very long. im very new to this fanbase but i love it. i mean, i didnt just hear about them, but ive known of them since whenever the first time i heard 21 guns was, and ive always thought they were allright. i never expected id become this huge of a fan. the song that really got me into them was holiday, which i heard for the first time only a few months ago. i hope the fact that i havent loved green day ever since they first started or ever since i was little or whatever doesnt make me any less of a true fan :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cassoulet ! :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m eating it alone !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>x)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Okay&hellip; :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is ridiculously catchy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>each album is different  1,039 and kerplunk was like garage band punk and DOOKIE was a lotta bass and teen angst and insomniac was more of a fast pace like speed punk like he&rsquo;s older and has different struggles than before</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this is one of my favorite albums. so sad that it&rsquo;s overlooked and underrated. castaway is my favorite song on warning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At 1:07 who else noticed &lsquo;lost and found&rsquo; then just subconsciously  started singing &lsquo;lost and found city bound in my dreams&rsquo;?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the way he says -Now i´m on my own</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on the first chorus sounds pretty awsome</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such a fun song to play drums too. My favorite off of Warning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is perfect for GTA

</li>
<li>
<p>perfect to do situps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I remember watching this exact video like 6 years ago or something xD NOSTALGIA WILL BE THE DEATH OF ME!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is one of my favorites&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love this song&hellip; So nostalgic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Man, I haven&rsquo;t listened to this since sixth grade. I love Green Day!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Am I the only one who was confused when I first heard the song? I didn&rsquo;t cheer l check the title, so I thought the entire time he was saying &ldquo;Gasoline&rdquo;. lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does this song not have one million plus views? Are the lyrics not good enough? Something isn&rsquo;t right here!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why am I reminded of City Escape from Sonic Adventure 2? Hm</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good song either way, :D</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love Green Day!!! Is the only thing in the entire world I&rsquo;ll ever love!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This Song It should have been in the movie Cast Way of Tom Hanks (2000)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My dad gave me this album last summer. Love it😁. Love and prayers,        Peter Cross</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bought Warning album when it came out and loved every song. One of my favorite albums ever and this my favorite song from the album. I&rsquo;ve always appreciated Green Day for making each album different and trying different stuff. Some people like bands to always stay the same, I love bands that evolve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>14 years after I first heard this song and it&rsquo;s still awesome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When i hear this song i thank of me and my befriend and where running around the halls in school im trying to stop him and stop his crazy ideas just like carly in icarly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish I was a teen on 1994 so I could enjpy all of the awesome moments of Green Day like Woodstock and the riot on september 9 1994 im only 13 and Green Day is in their 40&rsquo;s 😢😢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Green Day Castaway &raquo;&raquo; 5SOS Castaway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WILSON!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My favorite Green day song. In general, Warning is so underrated, especially this song.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Warning is such an underrated album. It has some absolutely GREAT songs. It was just a different sound for them was all. People were afraid to give it a chance.

<p>Never before have I encountered a song that somehow managed to make me feel both better and worse at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the best songs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In my opinion this is one of green day&rsquo;s best tracks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who&rsquo;s listening to this in 2018 ? Still one of the best underrated Green Day song !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in love with this song for years now! One of the most underrated Green Day song I must say. Love the bass line!</p>
</li>
<li></li>

<p>Best album. Third best song on it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of talking about how I like this song, I&rsquo;m going talk about how nice this lyric video is. The white to green effect you put in to match the song is really nice and something I haven&rsquo;t seen before in a lyric video before. Good Job</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Awesome song. Green day is amazing!!!</p>

<p>I know right! I just wouldn&rsquo;t want my kids listening to that, even though Green Day has some songs but it took me  10 years to figure that out (I listened to them my whole life soo i never really knew the song meanings) but with pop, ew the songs gross me out sometimes even. I just wanna make sure that my kid isnt going to to be an 11 year old clubber :3</p>
