<p>Welcome to the Post Drama Depression Disorder club, where we listen to all of the drama’s ost, search all possible related videos of the casts and stalk their social media profiles and you simply just can’t move on 😭😭😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What makes this drama so perfect because we cry not only for romance part between Captain Ri and Se-Ri. We cry for the friendship of their comrades, Se-ri family issue especially when her mother explain, we cry for many sacrifice scene, we cry for the village citizen friendship, and many more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>broooo the scene where the women of the village got seri’s new products with their faces on them (and the brand called “saudade” which means a feeling of longing or nostalgia for someone) 😭😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I got on the wrong train, and that train brought me here. It brought me to the place I&rsquo;ve yearned to come every morning and night. It brought me to my destination.&rdquo; -Captain Ri, Episode 16</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After Seri went back to South Korea, there were no episodes that I didn&rsquo;t cry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Someday, you&rsquo;ll find someone who&rsquo;ll love you and protect you” Someday&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Single ladies, our own kind of Captain Ri will come in the right time, someday ❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After finished all episodes of CLOY</p>

<li>
<p>Someone else: start watching another drama</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I tried to let go and convinced myself that I’ll never have you, BUT IT’S DESTINY who pulled us back together so HERE I AM AGAIN, watching you hold a FLOWER, as I play to you, the PIANO SONG FOR MY BROTHER. The PICTURES OF MY HEART will be yours as I give you ALL OF MY DAYS someday, where no one could LET US GO, even if the SUNSET will have to end ONE DAY.

<li>
<p>i don&rsquo;t understand the lyrics but i feel the moment of it in the movie and i just can&rsquo;t move on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ugh I feel so attached to this drama&hellip; even at night, before going to sleep, I always remember some scenes and imagine it. Myghad whose with me?!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This drama has officially dethroned Descendant of the Sun in my heart. It&rsquo;s such an awesome drama. The soundtracks, the actors, all of them is amazing!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never listened to these kind of songs. But because of cloy, despite of language, it seems like my mind automatically feels how painful and lovely these songs are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This comment section makes me miss cloy even more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kdrama that i don’t want to have an ending 😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Am I the only one who thinks that this is the only kdrama that is so good at giving so much warmth in heart? Captain Ri is so sweet and so gentleman and so adorable and so warm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My first K-Drama ever and I can&rsquo;t get over it. I CRIED and CRIED and laughed so much.. I feel lost w/o more Capt. Ri and Yoon Seri. Please do a Season 2 w/ them actually getting married and having twins. lol ugh.. TV is for fantasy reality right?! What a beautiful relationship. Would that we all loved like Capt. Ri &amp; Yoon Seri.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What Seri said is true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We do need a Six Month condolence period huhuhu</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feel so grateful to find this drama during this hard time (covid19). This drama is my first K drama. This drama inspire me a lot about Love, Friendships and other Humanity values that already almost lost in so many countries. This drama invoking the deeper feeling inside me, make me not only cry, but also smile and laugh a lot. Hopefully this drama not only entertaining us, but also inspire us to become a better person after this hard time pass. Hopefully this drama change this world to become a better place to all human being. And i will start it from myself. Love you all ❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are many good k dramas but this is the ONLY one out of hundreds of ones I&rsquo;ve watched that really made me feel attached and love. Anyone agree?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>captain Ri is the kind of man that you want to spend your whole life with because you know you’re in good hands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have never imagined I would EVER fall in love with a prime-time novel like this. But here I am, loving the series as much as the music. Thank you for posting this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot; I have been trying to live a good life &quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Gu Seung Jun</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine growing up without parents, getting by on your own in a foreign country, tried to get revenge only to be stopped by guilt/conscience so he just settled for the less (which is srsly nothing compared to his dad&rsquo;s whole company getting stolen) got in a pickle, tiptoed every nook and cranny of his home country only to end up in a place where he had to hide all the time with a price on his head, then he found his only reward (Seo Dan) for all his struggles, they just needed time, picked the shortest straw and ended up as someone who dies holding onto true love. Gu Seung Jun needs justice, I want another CLOY universe where the leads are Gu Seung Jun and Seo Dan. Crash Hiding On You. 🤡</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last night I just finished watching this, my first k-drama that I cried in every episode. serri and capt ri&rsquo;s love story, the soldier squad, almost everything.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>ps. sorry for my bad english

<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s gonna be so hard to find a drama that can dethrone CLOY from being no.1 in my heart.. I liked each and every scene in every episode.. There was no character that I didn&rsquo;t enjoy watching! I&rsquo;m gonna miss them all :')</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I play these songs 1 hour before my work. These songs just make me feel good and remember the emotions I have felt watching CLOY drama.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crash landing on you is one of the best korean series ever for me.When Captain Ri go back to North Korea , Se-ri cry and run forward him by passing border-line  scene is very depressed and makes cry .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This drama has the best soundtracks&hellip;.. Even though I couldn&rsquo;t understand the language, it is so soothing&hellip;.Crash Landing on You has become one of my favorite k-dramas&hellip;..Dramas like this make me want to believe in love&hellip;. I love you both Captain Ri and Yoon Se-Ri&hellip;.. ❤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We dont need a translator in order to understand the song, we just need to listen. The emotions are there. My riri couple are there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alberto and Seo Dan 😭. I cant move on with there last scene together in the ambulance 🚑 😓</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love all the scenes,,my first Kdrama,,I can’t sleep without remembering it all,,I cant move on😭😭😭OUR CAPTAIN RI AND MISS SERI ❤️❤️❤️I love you all ❤️❤️❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is art. I love this drama sooo much idk how I was going this whole time without it. They did an amazing job wow 100000/10.😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ok who else LITERALLY could NOT move on and watch another drama because you knew you couldn’t find ANOTHER perfect sad drama to watch 😭😭😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The scene when capt ri ran to the hospital after seri woke up from her coma and the way he tried to control his tears upon seeing her but failed to do so really made me cry so much. With flower ost as the background song weren&rsquo;t helping either.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The scene where seri thought that they all left and cried but then they all showed up while holding the cake and gifts that they got for seri is really memorable for me I don&rsquo;t know why</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i&rsquo;ve cried a lot of times yesterday while watching the last episode. But here i am still torturing myself to cry by listening to all these beautiful yet painful ost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We all deserve a man like Captain Ri who will protects us no matter what happened and can also risk his life just to protect the woman he loves❤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last two episodes made me bawl my eyes out , i looked like a puffed fish, listening to these songs now make me sad and happy , idk anymore lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That scene where all the comrades are running and eun dong left his shoes, then captain Ri came to put it on his feet 😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Dan finally found his true love but Alberto died😢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>17:34 the moment when Seri and Captain ri arrived at the borderline and parted ways ,nothing he can do ,but to take only a single step..was one of the most saddest part of the movie,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For everyone who loves” Crash Landing On You” to their very soul and so much it hurts like I do, looking for a similar drama please watch “My Love From the Star”. As I watched CLOY, I immediately notice the parallelism and similarities of the mentioned dramas and it turns out they have the same writer! I love the character chemistry, deep bond, mutual trust and genuine love for each other. I guarantee you, you will love it if you haven’t watched it yet 💖</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Honestly, I&rsquo;m  not a big fan of Kdrama,  but this drama can make me so addicted to watch again and again..  Captain Ri&rsquo;s character is like what I dream for.   Gentleman, protective, sweet, discipline etc. (pray for me, one day i will have my Captain Ri too) 😍</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks for those who create this video, ❤

<li>
<p>Is a very beautiful drama seriously is very Sentimental, it makes you laugh, you cry, it makes you angry, for a long time I had not experienced this type of emotions in a single drama. ✨💫</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really recommend it 🌟🌪🌊</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who sopport the  RIRI Couple?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish they together</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I started to listen to this soundtrack because I thought it would be a nice way to relax and enjoy myself. Now, 9 minutes in, I&rsquo;m almost crying, its reminding me too much of the show🤧</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cloy gave me unrealistic standards for other k dramas. why did this have to be my first k drama</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe i am the only person that rewatch the drama after it&rsquo;s finished, i can&rsquo;t move from this drama, the story is very unique and the chemistry between ri jeong hyeok and yoon sae ri is amazing looks so natural, i will miss this drama so much, i hope there will be season 2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>#riricouple</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That scene se-ri broke down during her birthday because she thought captain ri and his friends left. I cried with that scene huhu</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t recovered yet. CLOY really got me and here i&rsquo;m crying. 😞😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These songs beats all other Korean songs that I&rsquo;ve heard. They are even better than BTS or other top Korean band&rsquo;s songs :D  These songs go straight to my heart and make my heart fluttered &lt;3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I finished last episode at 10:30 last night and i was literally crying till 12&hellip;.they are just love❣️❣️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weeks after watching Crash Landing On You, I still can’t get over with it. I miss it, I hope it gets season 2 ☹️ It’s my happy pill this Covid-19. ❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I mean this is the best drama that i have even watched! Whenever i think about i start crying i don&rsquo;t even know why but it just hurt me that they suffered ( i know that it&rsquo;s an acting) but i lived with every moment in the drama I just can&rsquo;t get over it and how beautiful the story is ❤️

<p>My heart aches whenever I hear these songs.</p>

<p>This drama taught me that &ldquo;if you can&rsquo;t find you&rsquo;re oppa in south korea, maybe he&rsquo;s in north. &quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No doubt, This is My new favorite KDrama so far dethroning my Descendants of the sun 😭. So much love from the 🇵🇭</p>

<p>so far, the best k-drama&hellip; last time I can&rsquo;t even finish watching all the episode of DOTS&hellip; this drama made me hungry for the next&hellip; I love how both main character showed acting skills not in the sexual way, but in more heart-warm way&hellip; like everytime they met up, just stare at each other, no hug no kiss, but that&rsquo;s enough to catch my heart by their acting skills!! hyunbin oppa, yejin unnie, jang!! daebak for the OST as well&hellip; !! love yaya1!</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

<p>Almost 2 months finish watch #CLOY &hellip; but still cant move on. This story so beautiful, like perfect orchestration of relationship. Family, Love and friendship &hellip; #saranghae</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my habit  when im finished k drama , i will listen to their music , i miss every single scene already 😥</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Favorite!!  Mungkin ada yg susah move on dari k-drama ini..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kl gitu kita sama, haha &lt;3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now I am crying listening to &ldquo;Pictures of my Heart&rdquo;. This song is mostly played on the North Korea scenes. And it made my heart ache for some reason. 😫😫😫 I don&rsquo;t know, I feel like the characters on the drama are all true and they exist. I hope they have a happy life there in north 😫😭😭😭😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can say it that Crash landing on you is the best ever drama which i watched soo far, it is soo beautiful and the story line is great, as well as the actors and actress. Capitan Ri is just a husband material like for real i wish i could meet somebody like him; intelligent, gentlemen, sweet and does Bambi eyes. This is the first drama where a male lead is just not throwing some cringe words. The chemistry of every actor and actress is just beyond something finally worth of watching. I was crying on some episodes especially when they separated it was sad but i laughed a lot as well. Emotional swing. The music for this series fits as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Korean drama that stole my attention and my heart omg! I cried tru out the series and laugh as well i like those 4 gentlemen behind Mr. Ri his comrade&hellip;hahaha they are so funny and nice chemistry hope they will have movie together..i love story of brotherhood here and the sisterhood of those old ladies&hellip;good bonding nice lesson i hope will love each other and help each other no matter what i love the attitude  haaa lot to say perfect story..lets not forget to help other who helped us during the tough times&hellip;i like that they were like family after in north korea..love the bonding of everyone in the story..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I never see ost like their really everything are heartbreaking and so good</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m so attached with this K-drama 😭 Very heart touching just like a real love story. I will miss every character. This K-drama dethroned &ldquo;The Last Empress&rdquo; in my heart. Love conquers all. Hope there will be a part 2 😅</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reading the comments made this more emotional 😭😭😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the scene where Seri and Captain Ri was questioned together because both of them were telling a different stories and when Seri walked her way out and fainted after captain Ri harsh words&hellip; I cried so hard that my brain hurts x(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&lsquo;Crash Landing on You&rsquo; is officially one of my favorites of all time. And the music&hellip;OMG&hellip; I don&rsquo;t even know the words but I want to listen over and over.. I feel all the emotions in the melody and pitch.  Idk if Korea has entertainmemt awards but they need to win them of them!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We shed both sad and happy tears on this movie. 😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i cried so much with this drama and i usually dont cry in kdramas! It was so fantastic and different and i loved the actors!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Listening to pictures of my heart while eating noodles at 9 PM. I can’t get over the heavy scenes 😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let Us Go reminds me of their switzerland scenes😭 coz their love story actually starts there😍😍</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Among all the leading man, Captain Ri&rsquo;s character really shows how much he love Se-ri!!!😍 that until now its driving me crazy😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>track 7 will always remind me of U-pil&rsquo;s father TT he was my fav throughout the drama &lt;3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flower reminds me of the scene where jeong hyeok holds up a scented candle for seri when she got lost in the market ;-;

<li>
<p>K-Drama soundtracks, why are you so good? Trying to take all my money&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You know this is the best kdrama. Their story were really destined. They met at switzerland years ago and they met when Se ri paraliding landed in North Korea and at the end they met also when Seri paragliding landed in switzerland. The best plot twist</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i cant when sunset start playing at the drama 😭❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When captain ri almost shot himself made me cry so hard😰</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This the the BEST drama that I have ever seen!! Can&rsquo;t forget the wonderful story and beautiful music!! PERFECT!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow, the music of this drama is so much more memorable then I expected!  I really love to hear these songs after the drama now!😢😊🤞</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the first time that i finished 10episodes of Kdrama in 1 day start from 5AM TO 7PM with 2 hrs break 😭</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>THIS SERIES really worth the watch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the touching Kdrama , Picture of my Heart was a wonderful and full of emotion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beautiful soundtrack for this drama, which includes excellent performances by its protagonists and co-stars. Story that reaches the heart and worst of all is that it remains marking a beautiful moment, at least for me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really love all this songs in crash landing on you, remind me how their love unite(destiny), nakakabaliw pagnanood ito, till now i cant get over even i sleep nakikita ko c captain ri jeong yeok.. Heheh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CLOY is addictive😄♥️! Have watched all 16 episodes in 2 days. Slept at dawn, went to work at 8am. Watched in the car on the way to my meetings. After work went straight to my room to watch the remaining episodes. After I&rsquo;m done watching the 16 episodes, I watched back my favorite scenes in each episode😄</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can&rsquo;t move on :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That scene where they are going back to North Korea broke my heart</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just perfect romantic movie! How I wish there’s still a Captain Ri  left in this world ♥️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really love the OST of CLOY it gives me a nostalgic feeling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The writer of the story and the director of this movie are adorably genius! And the lead actors have portrayed superbly their roles.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>No scene of Mr Ri and Yoon are boring. I admire how they act with their eyes, with the smile, the facial expression, the body gestures and the tone and delivery of each line. And how pleasing it is to look at Hyun Bin&rsquo;s face, his physique and how well he dressed up.

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes the wrong train takes you to the right station. It was like that for me, too. Throughout my life, I always felt like I was on the wrong train. One time, I wanted to give up. I didn&rsquo;t want to go anywhere. So I thought of jumping off the train. Look where I am now. I took the wrong train again, and a very wrong one at that. Still, you should think about the future, even if things don&rsquo;t go as you wish. I hope you arrive at the right station, no matter which train you take.&rdquo;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Seria maravilhoso uma segunda temporada! O melhor Kdrama de todos os tempos. ❤</p>
</li>

<p>This is one of the BEST dramas out there. So much to be happy for and to cry for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This songs made me cry too much, but thanks for making me cry 🥺♥️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish Seung Jun and Seo Dan ended up together😭😭😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Listening to song no. 7 reminds me of N.Korean people, how they live their life there really make me feel sad. I watch there&rsquo;s a video on youtube, N.Korean ppl explain about their reality of life through this drama. But actually the real thing is more worst. Can you imagine they only get 2 hours of electricity only per month especially for poor people outside of Pyongyang.. So as a human we should always be grateful on what we got.. Never compare our life with someone that is higher than you.. Always think of people that bellow us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This drama make me Crazy , because I&rsquo;m single 😂🙈 but i&rsquo;m always cry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The best drama. ♥️</p>
