<p>Image Source : FACEBOOK Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s ex-manager Disha Salian&rsquo;s last video from hours before she died goes viral</p>
<p>Just a week before actor Sushant Singh Rajput died by suicide on June 14, his ex-manager Disha Salian had allegedly jumped off a building and killed herself. As the actor&rsquo;s death case is undergoing investigation, Police have been trying to find if there is a connection between the two suicides. Disha Salian was the former manager of Sushant for a very brief period of time but her family claims that she never mentioned Sushant&rsquo;s name to them. Recently, a video of Disha Salian partying at a house before she allegedly died by suicide or fell from the 14th floor of the building surfaced the internet.</p>
<p>The video shows Disha recording her friends enjoying the party and dancing to the beats of Hrithik Roshan&rsquo;s song Rind Posh Maal from the film Mission Kashmir. It is said that the video was taken on the night Salian died. Reports claim that Disha was depressed and had locked herself in a room. When her friends tried to reach her but she didn&rsquo;t open the door, they pushed it open to find out that Disha has jumped off the balcony.</p>
<p>Check out the video here-</p>
<p>Meanwhile, talking to a news channel, Disha Salian&rsquo;s mother said, &ldquo;This cannot have a connection with Sushant’s death, she never took his name. We didn’t know that she was Sushant’s manager. We came to know later. Only once, she had told us that she had gone to Sushant’s house with somebody. How can there be a connection in meeting him just once? She was his manager for a very short time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disha&rsquo;s mother also said that they can&rsquo;t believe that she died by suicide as they were talking about her wedding. She said, &ldquo;We don’t believe that she could die by suicide. She was a very brave girl. We don’t know what happened in the last moment. We used to talk about her wedding.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am not afraid of anything. I am not going to get my daughter. I don’t care what will happen of me. Even if I die, my life has no value, Disha was my future and now she’s not here and now I don’t even worry about her. What more can happen in our life now,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Also, Disha Salian&rsquo;s father has said he does not suspect any foul play in her death and he is &ldquo;completely satisfied&rdquo; with the probe being conducted by Mumbai Police in the case, an official said. In a letter sent to assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Malvani, Satish Salian alleged that media persons were harassing his family by repeatedly questioning their faith in Mumbai Police and their way of inquiry into her death, the official said.</p>

<h3 id="last-video-of-sushant-singh-rajputs-ex-manager-disha-salian-surfaces-online">&ldquo;Last video of Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s ex-manager Disha Salian surfaces online&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.deccanherald.com/sites/dh/files/articleimages/2020/08/08/disha-1596902892.jpg" alt="img">
In a new twist, the last video of Disha Salian, ex-manager of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput, has surfaced online – in which she is seen merrily dancing with a group including her boyfriend and actor Rohan Rai.</p>
<p>On June 8-9 midnight, Disha (28), died after falling from the 14th floor of the Galaxy Regent building at Malad in the northern suburbs of Mumbai.</p>
<p>Disha, a resident of Dadar, had gone to party at the house of Rohan Rai, a TV actor. The Malvani police station has registered an accidental death report (ADR) in the case.</p>
<p>Also read: No links with Disha Salian or her death: Sooraj Pancholi</p>
<p>Disha can be seen along with a few others in the video and looking happy. They are dancing to &lsquo;Mission Kashmir&rsquo; song &lsquo;Rind Posh Maal&rsquo; featuring Hrithik Roshan.</p>
<p>Disha’s death has been linked to the death of Sushant Singh Rajput, and several people have demanded that both the cases be clubbed.</p>
<p>Former Maharashtra chief minister and BJP Rajya Sabha member Narayan Rane has claimed that Disha was raped and murdered - days before Sushant Singh Rajput was killed.</p>
<p>Disha’s parents Satish and Vasanti Salian had ruled out any foul play. “All theories and stories are fake and just rumours. I lost my only child but now all these media people, social media people will murder us. Therefore, I request to stop all this. I request the Supreme Court to stop all this, we are badly suffering because of this. Now we don&rsquo;t have any strength to listen to all these fake news against our daughter,” they told a TV channel.</p>
<p>Actor Sooraj Pancholi, who was linked to the death of Disha Salian, had categorically said that he never knew Disha.</p>
<p>ED grills Showik again</p>
<p>Rhea Chakraborty’s brother Showik was grilled on the second day by the Enforcement Directorate on Saturday. Rhea and Showik, who were partners in Sushant Singh Rajput’s company, were grilled on Friday for over eight hours. Rhea is likely to be called again by the ED.

Disha Salian’s case is also coming back in the headlines. A video is going viral on social media, which is being told a few hours before he committed suicide. It has been shot by Disha herself, in which she is seen dancing and dancing with her fiancé Rohan Rai and friends.</p>
<p>Disha Salian last video before her death</p>
<p>From social media to media, it is being said that the death of Sushant Singh Rajput and Disha Salian has a connection with each other. Many theories are coming about the connection of both.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a video of Disha has surfaced on social media on Saturday. According to reports, this video is about an hour before his death. In the video, Disha is seen dancing with her fiance and some close friends.</p>
<p>Earlier, Disha’s mother, speaking to a news channel, said that on the day of her death she went with her fiance to a friend’s house in a small gate-to-gayder.</p>
<p>At the same time, this video is being claimed that this video was posted in the WhatsApp group of friends by Disha at 11:48 pm on the night of 8 June.</p>
<p>Within about an hour, she committed suicide. In the video, Disha looks quite happy with her fiance Rohan.</p>
<p>Now the question arises that if Disha Inni was happy, then how and why did she take a step like suicide?</p>

<p>Disha’s mother said don’t give unnecessary attention</p>
<p>Talking to a leading channel, Disha’s mother Vasanthi Salian said that a lot is being said on the media and social media about my daughter, but the truth is that all those things are wrong and nothing more than rumors. He further said that Malavani police is looking at Disha’s case and statements have been taken twice in this case. We have all the necessary documents and records. The Mumbai Police is doing its job well, because we saw the post-mortem report, in which no such thing was revealed, which is being told to us now. We are very sure of the Mumbai Police.</p>
<p>Told the truth to the party</p>
<p>Vasanthi told the video that was going viral, ‘Disha’s birthday comes on May 26 and friends like her brother Indranil’s birthday on May 25, celebrating both together every year. But this year he could not celebrate due to the lockdown. So they partyed the night before his death. To say that it was not even a party, it had only 6 friends, it was a small gate to gether. ‘</p>
<p>Father accused of tarnishing image</p>
<p>Disha’s father Satish Salian lodged a written complaint with the Mumbai Police, stating that an attempt was being made to defame his daughter’s name. Wrong and objectionable posts are being shared on social media about his daughter, which is also tarnishing her family’s image.</p>
<p>Mumbai Police again active in this case</p>
<p>Former manager of Sushant Singh Rajput, Disha Salian, died on June 8 after falling from the 14th floor of a Mumbai building. 57 days after Disha’s death, Mumbai Police has asked people for information related to them. Malwani Police has issued a press note saying that if anyone has information related to the accidental death of Disha, he should make it available to Malvani police in Malad.</p>
<p>Disha’s body found without clothes</p>
<p>At the same time, a channel has told in its report that the body of Disha was found by the police body nude ie without clothes. Along with this, there are also claims of several wounds on his private part. At present, the case has caught fire again.

<h3 id="sushant-singh-rajput-disha-salian-death-and-post-mortem-7-big-questions-answered">&ldquo;Sushant Singh Rajput, Disha Salian death and post-mortem: 7 big questions answered&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202008/sushant-singh-rajput-disha-sal-647x363.jpeg?.RcSt2G3bQZ7Xyse3VA3cQQ8gRvYpZas" alt="img">
The deaths of Sushant Singh Rajput and Disha Salian have thrown up several big questions. We answer 7 of the biggest questions regarding the death and post-mortem.</p>
<p>The Sushant Singh Rajput death saga has thrown up numerous questions, what with political parties throwing their weight behind the case, and the Supreme Court too involved now. Two states are fighting over jurisdiction and investigation in the case, and justice still seems a while away. Now, the Central Bureau of Investigation has also entered the fray. The CBI is in touch with the Bihar Police, they said today, and the FIR will be up on the CBI&rsquo;s website soon. But while conspiracy theories run amok and the clamour for justice grows with every passing day, we try to sift through the noise and get you answers. Answers to seven big questions that the Sushant Singh Rajput death and the Disha Salian death have made us ponder on no end.</p>
<p>India Today got in touch with the Mumbai Police investigating officer who is on the Disha Salian case, and one of the doctors who performed Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s autopsy at Cooper hospital in Mumbai.</p>
<p>HERE ARE THE ANSWERS TO THE 7 BIG QUESTIONS</p>
<p>1 Disha Salian died at 2 am on June 9. Why was her post-mortem conducted on June 11?</p>
<p>Disha Salian According to Mumbai Police officials investigating the case, for post-mortem now, Covid-19 test is compulsory. Disha&rsquo;s body was brought to the hospital for post-mortem immediately. Covid-19 test was done, of which reports come after 24 to 36 hours. Till that time, her body was kept in the morgue. The cops said nowadays, during the Covid-19 pandemic, a Covid-19 test is must. After Covid-19 test said negative, the post-mortem of Disha&rsquo;s body was conducted on June 11.</p>
<p>2 Disha Salian&rsquo;s vaginal swabs were taken. Where are the results?</p>
<p>Disha Salian Vaginal swabs and other swabs were taken for intoxication at FSL (Forensic Science Laboratories) office, Kalina. Mumbai Police is awaiting the report. They have asked the FSL to provide report soon.</p>
<p>3 Why was Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s post-mortem conducted after sundown, on June 14; the same day he died?</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput Police officials came to us with the inquest and requested the post-mortem be done, so it was done at that hour. There is no rule that post-mortem cannot be performed at night. A circular issued in 2013 allows post-mortem at night.</p>
<p>4 Did a magistrate authorise Sushant&rsquo;s post-mortem after sundown?</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput A magistrate&rsquo;s permission is only required in cases that are under 176 CrPC, like custodial death, riots, etc. This case is under 174 CrPC, where police have powers to request for post-mortem and as per police inquest, post-mortem is done.</p>
<p>5 Who all from Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s family were present during the post-mortem?</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput We don&rsquo;t remember who from the family were present during the post-mortem. Police came with his sister&rsquo;s signed statement and requested the post-mortem. It was later that Sushant&rsquo;s brother-in-law, ADG Haryana Police [OP Singh] and sister were at the post-mortem centre.</p>
<p>6 Sushant&rsquo;s post-mortem report mentions ligature marks. Then, why does it say no injuries?</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput If you go through the Column 17 of the post-mortem report, ligature marks are mentioned; and except that, there were no injuries.

<p>Updated: Aug 05, 2020 22:34 IST</p>
<p>Celebrity manager Disha Salian’s father Satish Salian has written to the Mumbai Police, seeking action against journalists spreading ‘fake news’ about her death and defaming her. In his letter, he said that the stories ‘hold no truth’ and were fabricated for the sake of TRPs.</p>
<p>Disha was the former manager of Sushant Singh Rajput and died on June 8, days before his suicide on June 14. Some reports suggest that the deaths are linked to each other.</p>
<p>India Today reports that the subject of Satish’s letter drew the police’s attention to ‘mental harassment’ caused to the family by journalists. “I am writing this to you as my family has been continuously harassed by journalists and media people in relation to the death of my daughter Disha Salian,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Satish said that he had submitted a written complaint in Malvani police station against ‘derogatory posts and forwards’ on July 13. “In addition to the said letter, I would like to bring to your attention the atrocities of journalists and media people on my family. The media people come unannounced at my house hiding their original brand in the name of interviews regarding the death of my daughter. They are providing the media with misleading news which are not only creating hindrance to the actual inquiry being conducted, but it’s also taking a toll on my family,” he said in the letter.</p>
<p>“We are being harassed by these people by repeatedly questioning our faith in Mumbai Police and their way of inquiries conducted. We have already given our statement to the police that we do not suspect anyone of foul play,” he added.</p>
<p>Also read: Shweta Nanda tells brother Abhishek Bachchan to ‘hang in there’ as he remains hospitalised for Covid-19</p>
<p>Satish said that stories about Disha being involved with politicians and attending high-profile parties were being fabricated for television ratings. “News about her involvement with any politician or attending parties with big names of film fraternity, rape, murder are all the stories cooked by these media people just to sell it to channels. These stories hold no truth. These are misleading the people and tarnishing my daughter’s reputation and my family’s reputation. These fake news are taking a huge toll on my family’s health and we are being victimised by the media,” he wrote.</p>
<p>“We are completely satisfied with the investigations being conducted by Mumbai Police and have faith in them,” Satish added. He also requested the police to take action against the journalists, influencers, politicians and media houses responsible for spreading such news about Disha.</p>
<p>Disha fell to her death from the 14th floor of a high-rise building on the night of June 8. Her mother has earlier said that she does not think it is in any way connected with Sushant’s death.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, KK Singh alleged in an FIR that Rhea Chakraborty threatened to frame his son Sushant for the death of Disha. KK Singh has filed an abetment to suicide case against Rhea and accused her of misappropriating Sushant’s funds.</p>

<p>Every statement that doesn’t fit their fake narrative will not be shared.. will not be believed.</p>
<p>If you’ve already decided what you want to believe, stop pretending to find the truth. Please don’t act like you care. https://t.co/bHzbNxiBIl — Kritika Kamra (@Kritika_Kamra) August 8, 2020</p>
<p>Actor Kritika Kamra also tweeted on similar lines. “Every statement that doesn’t fit their fake narrative will not be shared.. will not be believed. If you’ve already decided what you want to believe, stop pretending to find the truth. Please don’t act like you care,” she wrote.</p>
<p>Disha’s father Satish Salian told India Today that the rumours being spread about his daughter and her death were false. “As media has freedom of speech, we also have right of privacy, do not interfere in our life please. I request you all please. Police have explained me. They showed whole case evidences, post mortem report. My daughter was never pregnant, she never got pregnant. Rape never happened, organs are clear,” he had said. Disha allegedly killed herself by jumping off a high-rise in Mumbai’s Malad area on June 8.</p>

<p>BJP MP Narayan Rane on Tuesday claimed Disha was killed, and indicated the murder may have been preceded by her rape. He claimed the postmortem report mentioned injuries to her private parts.</p>
