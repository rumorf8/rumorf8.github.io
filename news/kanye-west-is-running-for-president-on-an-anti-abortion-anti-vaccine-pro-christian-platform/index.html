<p>Somehow, although Kanye West has teased a presidential run for years, his announcement on the Fourth of July still came as a surprise.</p>
<p>We must now realize the promise of America by trusting God, unifying our vision and building our future. I am running for president of the United States ! #2020VISION — ye (@kanyewest) July 5, 2020</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>It’s unclear whether the artist will ever actually appear on a ballot — he hasn’t yet registered with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and has already missed the deadline to file as an independent candidate in many states. But if he does, here’s what we know about his platform.</p>

<p>NO, TWITTER HASN&rsquo;T CANCELLED HAMILTON &ndash; ALTHOUGH SOME ARE CALLING FOR IT</p>
<p>HALLE BERRY GIVES UP TRANSGENDER ROLE AFTER BACKLASH</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>West is not a traditional Democrat nor a Republican.</p>
<p>In fact, in an interview with Forbes, he declared that he is running under &ldquo;the Birthday Party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“Because when we win, it’s everybody’s birthday,&rdquo; West told Forbes.</p>
<p>The artist known for saying, &ldquo;George Bush doesn&rsquo;t care about Black people,&rdquo; during a Hurricane Katrina relief concert, has since become increasingly critical of the Democratic Party. While he didn’t vote in the 2016 election, he said he would have voted for Donald Trump, but maintained that he was not a Democrat or a Republican.</p>
<p>Still, he told Forbes that he would run as a Republican, rather than as an independent, if Trump wasn’t running.</p>
<p>West is no longer supporting Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Despite hinting that he would postpone his campaign until 2024 at the beginning of this year, West is breaking off his support of Trump’s reelection campaign with his announcement.</p>
<p>“I am taking the red hat off, with this interview,&rdquo; he told Forbes, adding that he was dissatisfied with the president’s response to the coronavirus pandemic and protests over the death of George Floyd. “I don’t like that I caught wind that he hid in the bunker.”</p>
<p>West denies accusations that the announcement is a publicity stunt for his upcoming album and a form of supporting Trump by taking votes away from the Democratic nominee.</p>
<p>“That is a form of racism and white supremacy and white control to say that all Black people need to be Democrat and to assume that me running is me splitting the vote. All of that information is being charged up on social media platforms by Democrats,&rdquo; he told Forbes.</p>
<p>Our country is in a historic fight. Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.</p>
<p>West is a devout Christian.</p>
<p>While his music has invoked God and Christianity since his first album, &ldquo;The College Dropout,&rdquo; West has called himself a “born again” Christian. His most recent album, &ldquo;Jesus Is Born,&rdquo; is the debut of West&rsquo;s gospel group, Sunday Service Choir, which has since performed across the United States. And his religion informs his political views.</p>
<p>As a candidate, he is anti-abortion and anti-vaccine, and cites God as his reasoning for both those stances.</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they say the way we’re going to fix Covid is with a vaccine, I’m extremely cautious. That’s the mark of the beast. They want to put chips inside of us, they want to do all kinds of things, to make it where we can’t cross the gates of heaven,&rdquo; he told Forbes.</p>
<p>West also wants to reinstate school prayer and end capital punishment, citing one of the Ten Commandments, &ldquo;Thou shalt not kill.&rdquo; Even when it comes to more secular issues, such as taxes and environmental protections, West told Forbes he still needs to research more and consult &ldquo;the strongest experts that serve God,&rdquo; before committing to a stance.</p>
<p>West wants to end police brutality, but also protect police officers.</p>
<p>As a Black man, West has come under a great deal of scrutiny for his remarks on race, including a 2018 comment to TMZ that, “When you hear about slavery for 400 years: For 400 years, that sounds like choice.”</p>
<p>West has since apologized, but some of his stances on race and policing remain controversial. He told Forbes that he wants to end police brutality, but also put importance on the fact that, “the police are people too,” citing the example of J. Alexander Kueng, a Black police officer facing charges of aiding and abetting in George Floyd&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So if it’s your first day on the force and it’s your training day, and this OG accredited cop with 18 violations already starts filing out, are you going to jump in front of that person and lose your job that same day? Especially in this climate when 40,000 people lost their jobs? This man was put in a position where—and also he probably didn’t realize that the cop was going to take it that far, he probably was so scared, in shock, paralyzed, like so many Black people. I&rsquo;m one of the few Black people that would speak openly like this,” West told Forbes.</p>
<p>Kueng, who held Floyd&rsquo;s back down while officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck, has been denounced by two of his own family members and publicly shamed for his involvement in Floyd’s death. But West’s statement highlights the fact that Black voters are not a monolith — and Kanye is certainly not one to conform.</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>West is still developing much of his platform.</p>
<p>He has never voted in his life, but if he becomes president, he told Forbes that he plans to run the White House in the image of Wakanda, the secret country in &ldquo;Black Panther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“Let’s see if the appointing is at 2020 or if it’s 2024—because God appoints the president. If I win in 2020 then it was God’s appointment. If I win in 2024 then that was God’s appointment,&rdquo; West told Forbes.</p>

Kanye West has denounced a US parenting organisation that has been promoted by his wife Kim Kardashian, as a conspiracy.</p>
<p>The 43-year-old rapper spoke out in his first interview since declaring his plans to run for the Presidency and hit out at Planned Parenthood.</p>
<p>The organisation says it provides essential health care services like STD testing and treatment, birth control, well-woman exams, cancer screening and prevention, abortion, hormone therapy and infertility services.</p>
<p>Kanye has denounced it as &lsquo;the devil&rsquo;s work&rsquo; as he claims he is &ldquo;following the word of the bible&rdquo; despite wife Kim&rsquo;s support of Planned Parenthood and her pro-choice views.</p>
<p>(Image: Getty Images)</p>
<p>Speaking to Forbes about his 2020 presidential campaign, Kanye revealed that he was running for office because he had received a message from God as the born again Christian set out some of his thoughts.</p>
<p>One of his main claims was that Planned Parenthood was the work of &ldquo;white supremacists&rdquo; which has prompted a swift response from the organisation.</p>
<p>Kanye said: “I am pro-life because I’m following the word of the bible. Planned Parenthoods have been placed inside cities by white supremacists to do the Devil’s work.”</p>
<p>(Image: REUTERS)</p>
<p>Planned Parenthood’s Director of Black Leadership and Engagement, Nia Martin-Robinson, hit back at Kanye&rsquo;s remarks in a statement.</p>
<p>She said: &ldquo;Black women are free to make our own decisions about our bodies and pregnancies, and want and deserve to have access to the best medical care available.</p>
<p>“Any insinuation that abortion is Black genocide is offensive and infantilising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The real threat to Black communities’ safety, health, and lives stems from lack of access to quality, affordable health care, police violence and the criminalisation of reproductive health care by anti-abortion opposition.”</p>
<p>Keeping Up With The Kardashians fans will recall that Kim was joined by her sisters Khloe and Kourtney at a Planned Parenthood clinic for a visit in 2017.</p>
<p>Kim publicly voiced her support at the time on Instagram, sharing a photo of them at one of the clinics, captioning it with: &ldquo;My sisters and I visited Planned Parenthood recently and learned that the House of Representatives forced through a bill that strips health care coverage from millions of people and raises health care costs, including Planned Parenthood patients.</p>
<p>“They are such an amazing place that provides so much to so many! #istandwithpp.”</p>

<p><img src="https://upnewsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Kanye-West-Receives-Backlash-After-Labelling-Abortion-as-the-Devils.jpg" alt="img">
WENN</p>
<p>The born-again Christian rapper is facing outrage online over his pro-life stance as he suggests white supremacists are behind abortion and calls it a threat to black community.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Kanye West has been chastised by Planned Parenthood officials for declaring abortion “the Devil’s work” and falsely declaring white supremacists are behind the women’s health organisation.</p>
<p>In a disturbing new interview with Forbes magazine, the controversial hip-hop star claimed he is simply “following the word of the Bible” by adopting a pro-life stance, and denounced the services provided by the non-profit as a threat to black communities.</p>
<p>“Planned Parenthoods have been placed inside cities by white supremacists to do the Devil’s work,” said the born-again Christian.</p>
<p>However, Nia Martin-Robinson, who serves as Planned Parenthood’s Director of Black Leadership and Engagement, has fired back at Kanye, insisting the facilities provide crucial, affordable healthcare options for all women, particularly minorities.</p>
<p>“Black women are free to make our own decisions about our bodies and pregnancies, and want and deserve to have access to the best medical care available,” she tells TMZ in a statement.</p>
<p>“Any insinuation that abortion is Black genocide is offensive and infantilizing. The real threat to Black communities’ safety, health, and lives stems from lack of access to quality, affordable health care, police violence and the criminalization of reproductive health care by anti-abortion opposition.” Kanye, who announced his candidacy for the 2020 U.S. presidential election on Saturday night (04Jul20), has yet to respond to the criticism, but his wife, reality TV star Kim Kardashian, has previously voiced her support for Planned Parenthood officials, who also offer wellness exams, birth control, cancer screenings, and other important services to those in need.

<h3 id="a-tearful-kanye-west-launches-presidential-campaign-with-rambling-rally">&ldquo;A tearful Kanye West launches presidential campaign with rambling rally&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;d=20200720&amp;t=2&amp;i=1526345015&amp;w=1200&amp;r=LYNXNPEG6J00J" alt="img">
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In his first rally for his last-minute presidential campaign, rapper Kanye West ranted against abortion and pornography, argued policy with attendees and at one point broke down in tears.</p>
<p>West, 43, a former supporter of President Donald Trump who has left voters befuddled over whether his campaign is genuine or a publicity stunt to help sell albums or merchandise, delivered rambling remarks during the event at a Charleston, South Carolina, wedding venue and convention center.</p>
<p>In remarks that lasted just over an hour, he denounced abortion, swore, called on random members to speak, appeared to be putting forward policy proposals on the fly, and made comments that left even those in attendance muttering in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Harriet Tubman never actually freed the slaves. She just had the slaves work for other white people,” he said at one point when discussing economic inequality.</p>
<p>The event, which was livestreamed on YouTube and carried on local television stations, did little to clarify whether West is genuinely attempting to win the presidency. The campaign he launched with a July 4 tweet has already missed here several deadlines to appear on key state ballots.</p>
<p>At times, he even seemed to suggest he was more interested in disseminating a message than winning the presidency.</p>
<p>“Freedom does not come from an election. The freedom comes from you not loading up the pornography. The freedom comes from you not taking the Percoset,” he said at one point.</p>
<p>West appeared on stage with “2020” shaved into the back of his head and wearing what appeared to be a military-style vest. He argued that abortion should be legal but heavily discouraged, suggesting he would promote a policy as president that anyone who gives birth to a child be given $1 million “or something in that family.”</p>
<p>Slideshow (5 Images)</p>
<p>West referred to the Bible and Christian teachings multiple times, and broke down in tears at one point while describing how he was nearly aborted by his parents.</p>
<p>“The only thing that can free us is by obeying the rules that were given to us for a promised land,” he said. “Abortion should be legal because guess what? The law is not by God anyway, so what is legality?”</p>
<p>The event carried few similarities with typical polished candidate events. The venue appeared to lack audience microphones, so West repeatedly told the crowd to be silent so audience members he called on could be heard.

<h3 id="kanye-wests-presidential-run-would-as-a-long-shot-write-in-candidate">&ldquo;Kanye West&rsquo;s Presidential Run Would As a Long-Shot Write-In Candidate&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://consequenceofsound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Kanye-West.jpg?quality=80" alt="img">
Kanye West</p>
<p>If Kanye West is truly serious about running for president in 2020, he’ll likely have to do so as a write-in candidate.</p>
<p>As Kanye will be neither the nominee of the Democrat or Republican party, he’d instead run as an independent or third party candidate. And as an independent or third party candidate, Kanye would not be guaranteed a spot on every state’s ballot: Each state has is own individual rules for getting on its ballot, including requiring a certain number of signatures. Obtaining such signatures in the middle of a pandemic would be a difficult enough proportion, but he would also have to do so in an extremely short timeframe.</p>
<p>Each state has a deadline for filing to run for president, and several of those deadlines have already passed. It’s too late to get on the ballot in Indiana, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, and Texas, according to Ballotpedia. Meanwhile, the deadlines for Florida, Michigan, Oklahoma, and South Carolina are just two weeks away.</p>
<p>If Kanye’s name isn’t listed on a state’s ballot, voters would specifically have to write in his name in order to vote for him.</p>
<p>Then there’s the issue of Kanye’s existing contractual obligations. Most notably, Kanye recently struck a 10-year deal with Gap to become the company’s creative partner. Under terms of the deal, Kanye is expected to launch his initial product line in early 2021. Gap is hoping that Kanye’s involvement will generate $1 billion in annual sales within the next five years.</p>
<p>While Kanye could table the deal in favor of a presidential run, being creative director of the Gap has been his life-long dream and it’s hard to see him jeopardizing it, even for the White House</p>
<p>All that’s to say, Kanye’s presidential candidacy faces a number of obstacles from the very onset, and we haven’t even mentioned the massive amount of money and infrastructure required to mount such a campaign. He has no staff, no defined policy platform. Donald Trump may have set a new standard for individuals being unqualified and unfit for president, but even he had at least some semblance of a campaign apparatus prior to launching his presidential bid.</p>
<p>Given Kanye’s impulsive nature, logic would suggest he didn’t consider many of these aforementioned points prior to firing off his Independence Day tweet announcing his candidacy. Once he realizes just how daunting of a proposition such a run would be, it’s likely he’ll abandon the idea outright. Cynics could also argue that he’s simply attempting to drum up publicity on the heels of new music being released.</p>
<p>But if Kanye is sincere about his desire to pursue the Oval Office, he does have a few things in his favor. He and his wife are both massively wealthy with universal name recognition and Trump-esque social media clout. As a Black born-again Christian, he would appeal to unique swath of demographics. And he already has the backing of at least one wealthy benefactor in Space X founder Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Presumably we’ll learn more about Kanye’s true intentions in the coming days, but the mere prospect of his presidential run is enough to have both Republicans and Democrats going to sleep on Independence Day asking the question: What if?

Touch The Sky: Kanye West announces 2020 presidential run</p>
<p>Donald Trump and Kanye West stand together in the lobby at Trump Tower, December 13, 2016 in New York City, after Trump&rsquo;s election victory &ndash; but West apparently now wants to deny him a second term by running himself</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - Kanye West, the entertainment mogul who urges listeners in one song to &ldquo;reach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud,&rdquo; announced Saturday he is challenging Donald Trump for the US presidency in 2020.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must now realize the promise of America by trusting God, unifying our vision and building our future. I am running for president of the United States! #2020VISION,&rdquo; the born-again billionaire rapper tweeted as Americans marked Independence Day.</p>
<p>He offered no further details on his campaign, four months before the November election.</p>
<p>West long ago broke ranks with most of the left-leaning entertainment industry to loudly voice his support for Trump.</p>
<p>In 2018, they met in the Oval Office &ndash; a surreal tete-a-tete that included a hug from the rapper as well as an on-camera rant featuring an expletive not often repeated for the White House press corps.</p>
<p>That year, West also delivered a lengthy soliloquy to a president who many deem racist, telling him he loved him &ndash; to the dismay of many Democrats and fellow artists.</p>
<p>But in 2019, during an interview with Zane Lowe of Apple Music&rsquo;s Beats 1 show, he said his support for Trump had been a way to razz Democrats &ndash; and announced his own presidential ambitions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be a time when I will be the president of the US, and I will remember&hellip; any founder that didn&rsquo;t have the capacity to understand culturally what we were doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was unclear to whom the artist was referring.</p>
<p>The announcement came days after West, who has taken a very public turn towards Christianity in recent years, released a new song, &ldquo;Wash Us In the Blood,&rdquo; along with an accompanying video including imagery from recent anti-racism protests.</p>
<p>Since 2018, his wife, reality star Kim Kardashian, has formed her own contacts with the White House as she champions criminal justice reform: she has successfully lobbied Trump to pardon a sexagenarian woman for a non-violent drug offense.</p>
<p>For weeks now Trump, criticized for his response both to the coronavirus pandemic and to anti-racism protests, has been lagging in the polls behind his Democratic rival, Joe Biden.</p>
<p>There was no immediate response to West&rsquo;s announcement from either candidate Saturday.
