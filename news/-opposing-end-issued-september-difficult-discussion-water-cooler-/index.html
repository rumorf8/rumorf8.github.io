<p>Sam Smith, Love Goes Ready to hear a heartbreak? Sam Smith&rsquo;s new album Love Goes offers a little something for old fans and new — for those looking for a classic Smith-esque power ballad, songs like &ldquo;Forgive Myself&rdquo; and &ldquo;Love Goes&rdquo; will scratch your itch. For those more inclined toward a dance-pop breakup anthem, songs like &ldquo;Dance (&lsquo;Til You Love Someone Else)&rdquo; or &ldquo;Another One&rdquo; will get you dancing and crying at the same time. It&rsquo;s their most eclectic album to date, making Sam Smith&rsquo;s Love Goes a necessary listen in these chaotic times.</p>
<p>Tegan and Sara, &ldquo;Make You Mine This Season&rdquo; Even though Halloween isn&rsquo;t over just yet, Tegan and Sara are ready to help you ring in the Christmas season with a brand new song. &ldquo;Make You Mine This Season,&rdquo; the pair&rsquo;s new track off of the upcoming soundtrack for Hulu&rsquo;s upcoming queer holiday movie Happiest Season, sees Tegan and Sara offering up a queer love song just in time for the holidays, letting their lover know that they are the only thing on their wishlist this year. Once you&rsquo;re ready to get in the Christmas spirit, be sure to pop this track on.</p>
<p>Reyna, &ldquo;7'11&rdquo; If you&rsquo;re looking for a pick me up this week, look no further than Reyna&rsquo;s peppy new single &ldquo;7'11.&rdquo; The song, named after the date guitarist/singer Vic Banuelos met her girlfriend, sees the sister duo deciding to throw caution to the wind and take a chance on their relationship. “I love this song so much, we co wrote it with one of my all time favorite bands Coast Modern and I am just so happy those dudes exist and that we made something together,&quot; Vic said in a statement of the track. &ldquo;7/11 was the day I met my girlfriend, I wrote this song thinking about how we were both hesitant to give into the relationship because it started long distance. Everything was new and exciting but scary at the same time. I was all in and I wanted it to work so this was my &lsquo;everything will work itself out&rsquo; anthem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Serena Ryder, &ldquo;Waterfall (feat. Melissa Etheridge)&rdquo; Sometimes, you just need to cry. That&rsquo;s a fact that singer-songwriter Serena Ryder explores with queer icon Melissa Etheridge on her brand new song &ldquo;Waterfall.&rdquo; With a driving beat and a sturdy baseline, the pair encourage their listeners to stop holding back the waterworks, and to simply &ldquo;Let it fall, like a waterfall.&rdquo; &ldquo;I have so many feelings that I have swallowed, and they add up, coming out one way or another – often by bypassing the truth, getting angry, defensive, even masking with partying or bad relationships,&rdquo; Ryder said of her song in a statement. &ldquo;I’ve found that tears are actually the best way to heal, because we actually release healing hormones when we cry. I’d love to normalize crying, and this is a song about the many times tears have healed me.”</p>
<p>Jordy, &ldquo;Lip Locked&rdquo; Rising queer pop artist Jordy is ready for cuffing season to start with his shimmering new vide. In the clip for his latest song &ldquo;Lip Locked,&rdquo; Jordy encourages his lover not just to kiss him, but to open himself up and get past the getting to know you pleasantries. With bright colors and some expertly color-blocked outfits, Jordy makes his love known in this stunning new video. &ldquo;We wanted the visual to reflect my personality — essentially showing what I have to offer, and what I’m looking for in return,&rdquo; Jordy tells Billboard of the new video. &ldquo;Vibrance, excitement, and confidence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesswar, &ldquo;Venom&rdquo; On her latest single, Fijian rapper Jesswar wanted to make sure she was representing for her people. Thus, &ldquo;Venom&rdquo; was born — a stunning single and video that sees the rising star laying down sick bars while backed up by a literal army of Pasifika women, as she spits &ldquo;Come and get it/ Still waiting for the credit/ Got venom in these lyrics/ Bodies drop when I spit it.&rdquo; &ldquo;It’s extremely important that my community is seen and seeing all the sissy’s come through felt like I had an army behind me,&rdquo; Jesswar said of her new song and video in a statement.&quot;‘Venom’ is the perfect introduction into the world I’ve been dreaming up. I felt I had been muzzled in the Australian music industry, and that definitely inspired the lyrics. I felt I&rsquo;d been stifled so much that this chant erupted into what is now the track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mickey Taylor, &ldquo;Jokes (feat. Lostchild) With his new video for &ldquo;Jokes,&rdquo; Mickey Taylor and Lostchild are trying to let their significant other down gently. Performing in a black and white void, with dancer Callum Sterling providing some awe-inspiring interpretive moves throughout the clip, Taylor and Lostchild bid farewell to their lover as they break the bad news to them that &ldquo;I was only making jokes when I told you/ That I loved you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Roberts, &ldquo;Freaks&rdquo; Wanna see what happens when Linda Belcher from Bob&rsquo;s Burgers writes a queer anthem? Look no further — John Roberts (the voice behind the iconic Linda) released his new video for &ldquo;Freaks&rdquo; today, a stunning dance-pop single produced by Junior Sanchez that sees the singer embracing everything that makes him weird and wonderful. &ldquo;It’s a song about letting your freak flag fly &ndash; an empowerment song for freaks and those who have been cast aside,&rdquo; Roberts said of the new track in a statement. &ldquo;Vote for your freakness!”</p>
<p>Loris &amp; Honey Davenport, &ldquo;Freaky Planet&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not really Halloween if you don&rsquo;t get a couple drag queens involved — lucky for us, Dragula&rsquo;s Loris and Drag Race&rsquo;s Honey Davenport are here to be your HallowQueens. On &ldquo;Freaky Planet,&rdquo; the pair&rsquo;s new single, Loris and Davenport are getting spooky just in time for the holiday, while using actual societal problems as the scary content of their song. &ldquo;Loris and I really sought out to create a piece where we spoke about what’s actually terrifying about the world we live in,&rdquo; Davenport tells Bilboard of the new song. &ldquo;This song is an anthem for people enduring the unending struggle of racism and social oppression on this Freaky Planet we all inhabit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kennedi, Self Rising singer-songwriter Kennedi wants to let you into her world. On her brand new EP Self, the singer explores the inner depths of her mind, taking on her own personal demons like drinking (&ldquo;Liquor Love&rdquo;), self-improvement (&ldquo;Better&rdquo;) and much more, utilizing her trap-pop sound as often as she can. &ldquo;The Self EP is exactly what it sounds like &ndash; myself and all of the raw emotions that come with me,&rdquo; Kennedi said of her new EP in a statement. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a snapshot into how I felt in the moments during the time I was writing these songs. It tells the story of my journey over the past year &ndash; my relationships and life experiences. Honest and raw. That is Self.&rdquo;

<h3 id="new-music-friday-jonathan-butler-luba-mason-dave-brubeck--more">&ldquo;New Music Friday: Jonathan Butler, Luba Mason, Dave Brubeck &amp; More&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://assets.jazziz.com/2020/10/zEqtey2R-jonathan.jpg" alt="img">
From a unique take on a Beatles classic to an invitation to cherish life’s beauty, here are six new songs you can listen to right now to start your weekend the right way.</p>
<p>Luba Mason, “Ticket to Ride” [Video Premiere]</p>
<p>Acclaimed vocalist Luba Mason released her new trio album, Triangle, on October 23. The record features a unique lineup of voice, vibes and bass, with Mason performing diverse material spanning the musical spectrum alongside Joe Locke and James Genus. Within the program, a version of The Beatles’ classic “Ticket to Ride” like you’ve never heard before, courtesy of the surprising instrumentation and the production work of Prince collaborator Renato Neto. You can watch our episode of JAZZIZ Live with Mason on our Facebook page.</p>
<p>Jonathan Butler, “Our Voices Matter”</p>
<p>Singer/songwriter/guitarist Jonathan Butler has shared a new, empowering single ahead of U.S. Election Day. “Our Voices Matter” features a star-studded lineup and is out now via Mack Avenue. The song is a response to the injustice and oppression that links George Floyd’s death with Butler’s own experiences of growing up in Apartheid-era South Africa. “[It] is a message for us to have conversations that bring forth change,” he explains via a statement, “that we cannot stay silent when our brothers and sisters are suffering, and that with our voices we can fight for just treatment of all, just like we did in South Africa decades ago.” Click here to purchase/stream “Our Voices Matter.”</p>
<p>Andrew Gutauskas, “Look Out!” [Song Premiere]</p>
<p>GRAMMY-winning saxophonist Andrew Gutauskas returns with a brand new eclectic selection of music, both original and arranged. Look Out!, his sophomore album, is released today via Outside In and carries a positive, timely message well-represented by its exciting title track. “[It] represents two themes,” he tells us, “it is an invitation to step back for a few minutes every day to appreciate life, music, friendship and the world around us while at the same time, encouraging everyone to be on the lookout for those agents who are trying to direct our attention towards the worst of humanity.” Click here to order Look Out!</p>
<p>Ambient Jazz Ensemble, “Scars”</p>
<p>“Scars” is a collaboration between Colin Baldry and vocalist Donna Gardier. It is also the lead single from Baldry’s new album with his Ambient Jazz Ensemble, Aura, out tomorrow via Here and Now. The new recording showcases the group’s cinematic jazz, which lies somewhere between nu-jazz and ambient electronica. Speaking of “Scars,” Baldry explains the song is “another example of the ‘hope over adversity’ theme that runs through the upcoming album, where quiet reflection grows into an uplifting message.”</p>
<p>Max Haymer, “Proof of Evil”</p>
<p>Whirlwind: Live at Sam First marks pianist/composer Max Haymer’s first album as a leader in twelve years, following Pickpocket from 2008. It is a testament to his muscular, inventive playing and finds him leading a trio with bassist David Robaire and drummer Dan Schnelle. Recorded live at L.A.’s Sam First jazz club, shortly before the pandemic shut down live shows, Whirlwind: Live at Sam First features three standards and six originals, including “Proof of Evil.” The composition was inspired by Herbie Hancock’s “Actual Proof” and Wayne Shorter’s “Speak No Evil.”</p>
<p>Dave Brubeck, “Over the Rainbow”</p>
<p>Verve will release the final studio recording from Dave Brubeck, a solo piano album entitled Lullabies, on November 6. The recording showcases Brubeck’s distinctive improvisational style on a set of well-known children’s songs, classic standards and originals, and was recorded as a gift to his grandchildren in 2010. A new video for Brubeck’s version of the beloved “Over the Rainbow,” has been shared. This follows the previously released video for another track from the album, “Brahms Lullaby.”</p>

&lsquo;Twas the day before Halloween, and music lovers already had sugar highs from candy and the latest pop confections they saved in their goodie bags.</p>
<p>Ariana Grande delivered Positions, which strings 14 tracks together with a sultry R&amp;B production for a narrative arch about a new relationship and the physical excitement that goes along with it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Sam Smith released Love Goes, a dazzling project that delves into the psychological pit of heartbreak but picks up the pieces that shimmer like diamonds and fashions them into a proper breakup record.

<h3 id="listen-to-paris-jacksons-debut-solo-song-let-down">&ldquo;Listen to Paris Jackson’s debut solo song ‘Let Down’&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Paris-Jackson.jpg" alt="img">
Paris Jackson has shared a brand new song – listen to ‘Let Down’ below.</p>
<p>It follows the release of the debut EP from Jackson’s band The Soundflowers last month.</p>
<p>The new song will appear on Jackson’s debut solo album ‘Wilted’, which is set to arrive on November 13.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Watch her ‘Let Down’ video below.</p>
<p>“I found so much healing through creating this,” Jackson said of the new album in an interview with AP. “And there are moments where I’ll listen back to certain songs and I’m like, ‘Wow I was so naïve.’</p>
<p>“But for the most part, it’s just like so much gratitude and joy that I get from listening to these songs and just seeing the development and the evolution.”</p>
<p>Paris Jackson recently said that she’s grateful that her father Michael Jackson made her wear masks while she was growing up.</p>
<p>Michael’s three children – Paris, Prince and Blanket – famously wore masks and face coverings whenever they were out in public in order to protect their identity.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>“For a long time I was just against letting the world in because I was just too scared to do it,” she said. “I have had to accept the fact that I do not and probably will never have a private life.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year Paris shared some unseen footage of her father as part of a trailer for her new reality series.</p>
<p>The series, Unfiltered: Paris Jackson And Gabriel Glenn, debuted via Facebook Watch back in June.

<p>Liam first revealed news about his new track on his socials earlier in the week, admitting it will be available to download on Friday 30th October, but he didn&rsquo;t mention he was working with Dixie at the time.</p>
<p>He told fans, &lsquo;Merry Christmas all! ❄️ Too soon?&hellip; I’m releasing a new single THIS FRIDAY to get you in the festive mood this year! It’s called #NaughtyList&hellip; And as an early present you can hear part of the track on TikTok NOW 🙌🏼&rsquo;. (sic)</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until Liam dropped a short snippet of the new single on his official Tik Tok page, that fans thought they could hear Dixie D&rsquo;Amelio&rsquo;s voice on the track.</p>
<p>Just one day before the release on Friday 30th October, Liam finally wrote on his socials, &lsquo;Well&hellip; I had this whole grand plan about announcing who was featuring on my new song #NaughtyList on Friday but you all did it again and found out! You’re all detectives! 😅</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m so excited to have @dixiedamelio join, so say hello, give her a warm welcome like I know you guys can and listen to our track on Friday! I have fallen in love with TikTok and I’m excited to have some fun leading up to the holidays with Dixie and her family…</p>
<p>&lsquo;As we approach Halloween and Christmas during such a whirlwind year it’s important everyone looks out for each other, so please join in the fun with us. We’re going to be doing a very special TikTok Live this weekend to tell you all about our plans for the next few weeks 🙌🏼&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Naughty List&rsquo; is Liam&rsquo;s second original Christmas song, after he dropped &lsquo;All I Want (For Christmas)&rsquo; back in 2019.</p>

<h3 id="sorry-but-this-weeks-new-music-really-does-slap">&ldquo;Sorry but this week’s new music really does slap&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://video-images.vice.com//articles/5f9c25032c4e04009cac3f98/lede/1604068805233-newmusic.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&amp;resize=1200:*" alt="img">
What the fuck happened this week? What the fuck happened that caused a cascade of popstars, both established and brand new, to say: “You know what, the world needs these bangers, and they need them right now.”? Was there some sort of industry pact that caused Dua Lipa, Ariana Grande and Sam Smith to press the ‘Upload’ button on their computers like XTina style, and unleash havoc upon the pop world? Either way, we do not deserve.</p>
<p>Alas, here we are. 30 October: an iconique day in pop history. Ariana got horny and dropped Positions, which features the excellent 69-ing bop “34 + 35”. Sam Smith got all in their feelings and released new album Love Goes, which features a very graceful and floaty electronic ballad called “Another One” about past lovers and putting on a brave face when they move on. Then Dua was like ‘You know what guys? Fuck it. Future Nostalgia slaps but here’s something else just to stir the pot’ and dropped a collaboration with Belgium-born Angèle called “Fever”. In the middle of a pandemic? Dangerous and yet we stan.</p>
<p>But there’s also a string of new alternative faces who really didn’t come to play either. Our queen Clairo has formed a fresh musical outfit with her friends called Shelly, and they’ve arrived with a sweet two-track single. Those missing the scuzzy despondency of Lil Peep will find solace in Daine’s new one, titled “Ascension”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Rose Gray, who we reckon could single handedly revive Britpop for a new generation with her Primal Scream-sampling “Save Your Tears”, makes a big mark this week. The video, shot with her best friends at parties and on maskless tubes pre-Rona, is a glorious reminder of what we have to look forward to when the Tory government actually develops a solid Track and Trace system. Then there’s Claudia Valentina, who saw the Big American Pop Girls doing things and was like ‘Let me try!’ with “4:15” and made an absolute smash in the process. Expect huge things from her.</p>
<p>In amongst all of this, our boy Bakar marked his comeback, Tierra Whack made magic with new track “Dora”, Manchester punk outfit Jungle Boys have made the scuzzy and growling “Forest”, TikTok superstar BENEE dropped a track with Lily Allen (!). There’s also some sprightly beachy pop from Dameer and a newly released track from Troye Sivan’s In A Dream EP called “10/10”.</p>
<p>K-Pop fan? You’re catered for too: new stuff from TOMORROW X TOGETHER and TWICE is also here. All that and more waits for you below.
