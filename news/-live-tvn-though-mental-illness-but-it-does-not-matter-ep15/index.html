<h3 id="steam-halloween-sale-is-here--will-depart-on-2nd-november">&ldquo;Steam Halloween sale is here &amp; will depart on 2nd November&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.htxt.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Steam-Halloween-Sale-2020-BG.png" alt="img">
With Halloween happening tomorrow Steam has kicked off the sale dedicated to it. It’s live right now and will run until 2nd November, which is next week Monday.</p>
<p>As expected there’s a focus on horror games and other, darker genres. You can visit the sale’s main landing page to see the highlights but, as with all Steam sales, it’s best to go to your wishlist to see if any games you’ve been watching have been discounted.</p>
<p>It’s also worth using tools like this to see if any games you’ve had your eye on have reached historical low priced during this sale. Just remember not to look at things in a vacuum. For example Red Dead Redemption 2 is on sale for 33 percent on Steam but it may cheaper on the Epic Game Store depending on your regional pricing and if you still have one of those handy $10 Epic coupons laying around.</p>
<p>Similarly we’ve had our eye on Deep Rock Galactic, which is discounted by 30 percent on Steam right now, but will be available for no extra purchase on Xbox Game Pass in November. All of this is to say: look around before buying anything in this sale.</p>
<p>Back to Steam and several games such as Dead by Daylight and The Long Dark are running events to tie into Halloween and the sale, so this may be the time to pick this titles up or buy them while they’re reduced. These two games are discounted by 60 and 66 percent respectively.</p>
<p>After being introduced in the Steam Summer Sale this year the Points Shop has been updated with creepy items to spruce up your Steam profile. There’s an animated avatar, an avatar frame, a profile background and two emoticons. You can view these new additions in the Points Shop here.</p>
<p>From the emoticons we find out that the two ghouls used in the key art of this sale (see the header image above) are named Edwin and Millicent.

<h3 id="halloween-specials-on-origin-too-with-the-scary-savings-sale">&ldquo;Halloween specials on Origin too with the ‘Scary Savings Sale’&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.htxt.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/EA-Origin-Scary-Savings-Sale-Dead-Space-Hand-Key-Arty.jpg" alt="img">
As we get closer to Halloween, more and more online stores will be running sales, with EA’s Origin platform no exception and the Scary Savings Sale is now on.</p>
<p>Running from now until 3rd November, the sale can be found right here and, as you may imagine, it’s not really focused on horror games.</p>
<p>Yes EA is more known for sports, The Sims, Star Wars and Sundry, all of which are on sale here. Just about the only horror titles here are from the Dead Space franchise.</p>
<p>Below are games we like and / or are currently discounted by a decent percentage as part of the sale:</p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag – 67 percent off</p>
<p>Dead Space – 90 percent off</p>
<p>Dead Space 2 – 75 percent off</p>
<p>Dragon Age: Inquisition – 50 percent off</p>
<p>Far Cry 4 – 70 percent off</p>
<p>Far Cry 5 – 80 percent off</p>
<p>For Honor – 75 percent off</p>
<p>Spore – 75 percent off</p>
<p>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order – 50 percent off</p>
<p>Titanfall 2 – 67 percent off</p>
<p>Before you click buy on anything above there are some things you should take note of.</p>
<p>First is EA Play, the publisher’s subscription service. A lot of the games above are included as part of this service, so it may be more cost effective for you to get a month or two of the service rather than buying any of these outright. EA Play is also going to be part of Xbox Game Pass, without the need for any additional purchases, in the near future.</p>
<p>Secondly the Steam Halloween Sale is predicted to go live in just a few days. EA recently made a big return to Steam so your games of choice may also be discounted there where you can make use of that store’s features like credit in your Steam wallet, trading cards and more. EA Play is also available on Steam, albeit with less games.</p>
<p>Lastly the Epic Store, the PlayStation Store, and the Humble Store are all having Halloween sales right now too.</p>

<p>Bang Chan of Stray Kids hosted the 77th episode of his weekly live segment set with a Halloween theme.It was several days early, but the bandmates had already donned costumes for an online fan meeting held earlier that day, he explained, with Lee Know as Chucky, Bang Chan as a vampire and Changbin as Woody from “Toy Story.”He acknowledged that he was inspired by “Twilight,” although it had been a while since he had seen the movies.“I’ll be your Edward Cullen today,” said the musician, adding that he did not do much for his skin tone since he is naturally quite pale.Meanwhile, “there are many songs I’d like to play today since many of you told me which song you’d like to listen to during the fan meet,” he said, rubbing his hands.The first song of the day was Keshi’s “Less of You.” He was happy to find the song in the recommendations, saying he loved how easy the artist’s songs are on the ears.Watch the full clip at <a href="https://www.vlive.tv/video/219729.Taeyong">https://www.vlive.tv/video/219729.Taeyong</a> of NCT went live from his home and played an impromptu game of Among Us.He was catching up with viewers and thanking the band’s fans around the world for helping them top multiple charts, as he chatted about his unique hair color &ndash; part blonde and part blue &ndash; when someone suggested they play the trendy game.“Shall we?” he obliged, breaking into a grin. He quickly issued a warning that he is really good at the game as he set up a room for the maximum 10 players.The idol burst into laughter when he saw that the minute &ndash; or second &ndash; he gave the name of the room, it was full.“It didn’t take even one second!” he exclaimed.He told participants not to follow him around, asking them to understand that this is the first time he was playing the map. He was planning to play just one round but pleaded to go for another as soon as that ended.Watch the full video at <a href="https://www.vlive.tv/video/219710.Lee">https://www.vlive.tv/video/219710.Lee</a> Know of Stray Kids marked his birthday dressed as the infamous Chucky doll character from “Child’s Play.”He was glad that fans liked how he looked from the ruffled orange hair to coveralls complete with scars on his face. The scars are bigger than those from the music video of “B Me,” he said, and the hair color is similar to that from when he promoted “God’s Menu.” The day’s hair color was from a spray bottle, he explained.Some viewers suggested they tell scary stories and he jumped right at the opportunity to talk about scary movies he has seen recently, including “Epitaph.” He was serene discussing horror movies and confided he actually is very into the genre &ndash; so much so that he even listens to frightening stories on the radio when he gets makeup or before going to bed.As for the upcoming Halloween, he recommended fans dress up as zombies, saying he likes them best.Watch the full clip at <a href="https://www.vlive.tv/video/219692.On">https://www.vlive.tv/video/219692.On</a> Sunday the bandmates of Tomorrow X Together discussed “minisode1: Blue Hour,” their third EP that is slated to come out Monday.Lest fans stay awake from too much excitement, they would not give out too many spoilers, they said playfully.The EP depicts how things look different as the bandmates go through changes in their friendship, Soobin began. Staying anonymous, the quintet read through the notes each of them had prepared.Although all five tracks are good, one said he instantly fell for the first, “Ghosting.”“I’ve tried writing lyrics since I loved the melody,” he went on, “and the theme changed twice while I was working on it, but I was so happy that some of the final version went into the completed song.”Another talked about how he had to work on his abs for the first time in his life since he had to wear a cropped T-shirt. Thanks to the workout, though, he liked how it came out, he said, making the others chuckle.Watch the full video at <a href="https://www.vlive.tv/video/219623.Naver">https://www.vlive.tv/video/219623.Naver</a>’s real-time broadcasting app V allows fans to interact with their favorite K-pop stars through live broadcasts.

<h3 id="psa-you-may-have-epic-coupons-expiring-on-1st-november">&ldquo;PSA: You may have Epic coupons expiring on 1st November&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.htxt.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Epic-Games-Store-Coupon-1st-November-Expire.png" alt="img">
Aside from free games every single week another way Epic convinces players to use their store is with $10 coupons which are handed out rather often. As a bit of a public service announcement it’s worth noting that some of these coupons will be expiring on 1st November 2020 at 09:59 AM.</p>
<p>For example, in our account, we have two such coupons which will both be going away come the beginning of next month. One is from the Mega Sale from June, and the other was a reward for adding Rocket League to your Epic account when it became free to play.</p>
<p>These are just the two we have and you may have others in your account. To check log into your account on the Epic Games Store, click on your username in the top right corner, and then click on “Coupons”</p>
<p>Aside from expiring these coupons also have one other limitation in the form of a minimum game price for the discount to be applied. For these $10 coupons the game you’re buying needs to cost $14.99 or more. As the Epic Games Store still doesn’t have a basket or cart function this also means you can’t buy multiple cheaper games all at once. Instead a single game you buy will need to cost $14.99 or more.</p>
<p>While the store still doesn’t support many local currencies the minimum game value and the discount itself does change depending on your region. Here’s a handy breakdown:</p>
<p>Currency Minimum purchase to get an Epic Coupon Coupon Discount Value USD 14.99 10 EUR 14.99 10 BRL 59.99 40 PLN 59.99 40 UAH 399.00 300 GBP 13.99 10 RUB 899.00 650 JPY 1 480 1 000 TRY 79.99 60 KRW 15 000 11 000 CAD 20.99 14 AUD 22.99 15 SEK 140 95 NOK 100 65 DKK 140 95</p>
<p>For most countries and territories without a supported local currency the store will default to USD, although there may be regional pricing so your dollar amount is different to those actually in the US. This is how the store works here in South Africa and in many other places.</p>
<p>Thankfully coupons can be combined with games which are discounted. That’s handy as the Epic Games Store is currently running a Halloween sale which has titles discounted by up to 75 percent.
