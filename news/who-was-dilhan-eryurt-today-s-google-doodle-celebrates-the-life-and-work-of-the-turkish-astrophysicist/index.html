<p>Today’s Google Doodle honours the life and work of Turkish astrophysicist Professor Dilhan Eryurt.</p>
<p>Born in 1926, Professor Eryurt went on to enjoy a distinguished career which saw her contribute to the Apollo 11 moon landing 51 years ago today.</p>
<p>Following a lifetime of achievement in astrophysics and astronomy, she sadly passed away at the age of 85 in her native Turkey on September 13, 2012, due to a heart attack.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a look back at her life:</p>

<p>Who was Dilhan Eryurt?</p>
<p>Professor Eryurt was born in Izmir, western Turkey, on November 29, 1926.</p>
<p>At an early age, her family moved from the city, situated on Turkey’s Aegean coast, to Istanbul, the country&rsquo;s cultural and economic hub.</p>
<p>The family relocated again shortly afterwards, trading Turkey&rsquo;s biggest city for its capital, Ankara.</p>
<p>It was here where Professor Eryurt honed her gift for Mathematics, which she eventually went on to study at university, back in Istanbul.</p>
<p>While studying at Istanbul University, Professor Eryurt developed an interest in Astronomy.</p>
<p>This interest blossomed in the following years, and saw her help open an Astronomy Department at Ankara University, before getting her doctorate there in 1953 after spending time at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p>Professor Eryurt later went on to move to Canada for two years with a scholarship from the International Atomic Energy Agency in 1959, before then heading for the United States, firstly to Indiana University, and after that to NASA&rsquo;s Goddard Space Flight Center, in Maryland.</p>
<p>At the time, she was the only female astronomer working at the institution.</p>
<p>Her work at the Goddard Institute included major breakthroughs in improving our understanding of the Sun.</p>
<p>She learnt that the brightness of the star had had decreased during its 4.5 billion years lifespan, meaning it was warmer and brighter in the past.</p>
<p>Her research proved pivotal in planning for space flights at the time.</p>
<p>In acknowledgement of her contribution to the 1969 Apollo 11 moon landing, Professor Eryurt was awarded the Apollo Achievement Award.</p>
<p>She later moved on to work at the California University, where she studied the formation and development of Main Sequence stars - a continuous band of stars that appear on plots of stellar colour versus brightness.</p>
<p>Professor Eryurt continued her research until 1973, when she returned to Turkey permanently to take up a position at the Middle East Technical University, in Ankara.</p>
<p>She had gone back temporarily five years earlier to organise the country&rsquo;s first National Astronomy Congress.</p>
<p>A few years after returning home, Professor Eryurt was awarded the Tübitak Science Award in 1977.</p>
<p>She eventually retired in 1993, drawing her illustrious career to a close.</p>
<p>She sadly passed away 19 years later in Ankara on September 13, 2012, due to a heart attack.

<h3 id="hilarious-ps5-design-memes--from-the-eye-of-sauron-to-a-gaming-coffee-machine">&ldquo;Hilarious PS5 design memes – from the ‘Eye of Sauron’ to a gaming coffee machine&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AD-COMPOSITE-PS5-Meme.jpg?strip=all&amp;quality=100&amp;w=1200&amp;h=800&amp;crop=1" alt="img">
SONY finally unveiled the PlayStation 5 yesterday, and its space-age design has sparked some hilarious memes.</p>
<p>The PS5 console, out later this year, got a ribbing on social media, where cheeky users compared it to a coffee machine and even the Pope&rsquo;s hat.</p>

<p>One Twitter user posted a photo in which the console replaces the tower that holds up the evil Eye of Sauron in the Lord of the Rings films.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t unsee it&rdquo;, they smirked.</p>
<p>Another stuck up an image with the console in place of a duck&rsquo;s beak, commenting: &ldquo;The PS5 design is pretty fowl&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sony gave gamers their first look at the PlayStation 5 during a live-streamed event on Thursday.</p>

<p>8 Next-gen console or Dubai hotel the Burj Al Arab? You decide</p>
<p>It showed off two versions of its next-gen console, as well as a handful of games landing on the machine when it hits shelves ahead of Christmas.</p>
<p>While some users praised the console&rsquo;s bold, black-and-white design, others took a more mocking approach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;PS5 - complete &lsquo;broadband router that came with your TV package&rsquo; vibe,&rdquo; one Twotter user joked.</p>
<p>Another wrote: &ldquo;The PS5 laying on its side looks like a half eaten sandwich/burger where the contents on the inside are sliding outside the bread/bun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The console was compared to Donald Duck&rsquo;s beak, the character Eve from Disney flick WALL-E, and even a dog with a pair of Pringles in its mouth.</p>

<p>Sony PS5 June event – what was announced?</p>
<p>Sony announced it was working on the PS5 last year but kept the console&rsquo;s design a secret for months.</p>
<p>The Japanese firm finally broke cover on Thursday, showing off a tonne of pictures and announcing there will be two versions of the console.</p>
<p>One is the PS5 proper, and then there&rsquo;s a Digital Edition – which has no disc tray.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll likely be a similar offering to the current Xbox One S Digital Edition – cheaper, but restricted to downloadable games.</p>
<p>8 Sony announced it was working on the PS5 last year but kept the console&rsquo;s design a secret for months</p>
<p>Microsoft is expected to make a similar spin-off movie with its next-gen Xbox Series X console.</p>
<p>Sony also showed off a ton of new games coming to the PS5.</p>
<p>They included new Spiderman, Gran Turismo and Hitman titles, as well as some new IPs to look forward to.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we still don&rsquo;t know the console&rsquo;s price, or its exact release date, with Sony sticking to a &ldquo;Holidays 2020&rdquo; window for now.</p>
<p>PS5 design FINALLY revealed with TWO new models coming later this year</p>
<p>PS5 specs – what&rsquo;s the latest news?</p>
<p>Sony used a special press conference in March to detail the PS5&rsquo;s specs.</p>
<p>The performance will be groundbreaking, Sony explained.</p>
<p>“Soon there are games that could never have been created before,” said Sony’s Mark Cerny, lead architect of PS5.</p>
<p>The console features a 10.28 teraflop GPU clocked at 2.234GHz.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fewer teraflops (or trillion operations per second), than the Xbox Series X, which is promising 12 teraflops.</p>
<p>Fortunately, much of game loading comes down to RAM, or fast memory.</p>
<p>And the PS5 boasts 16GB of nippy GDDR6 memory – just like the Xbox Series X.</p>
<p>8 The new console is out later this year</p>
<p>How much will the PS5 and Xbox Series X cost? Here&rsquo;s what you need to know&hellip; Respected Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter thinks we&rsquo;ll see a major price war. &ldquo;From what I&rsquo;ve seen, Sony&rsquo;s gonna have to charge $500 for the PS5,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Microsoft has a big balance sheet. If they wanna cut the price by $100 – just price below [PS5] and subsidise the first 10million [units] – they will. &ldquo;So I think that they&rsquo;re waiting to have Sony blink first, and then they&rsquo;ll reveal the price. Very likely $400.&rdquo; Fellow gaming industry insider Peter Moore agreed with Pachter&rsquo;s predictions. Moore was formerly an EA and Microsoft exec, and was speaking on the Bonus Round podcast. He said: &ldquo;Michael&rsquo;s right. What both companies are going through right now is: &lsquo;How much can we afford to lose in the first 12 to 18 months?&rsquo; &ldquo;&lsquo;What is our attach rate of software to hardware? What are we willing to do in year one, two and three to hit 10million [units]?'&rdquo; Sadly, neither Microsoft nor Sony have confirmed pricing for either of their consoles – or even hinted at a range.</p>
<p>PS5 release date – when is the new console out?</p>
<p>In a blog post, PlayStation boss Jim Ryan said: &ldquo;Since we originally unveiled our next-generation console in April, we know that there’s been a lot of excitement and interest in hearing more about what the future of games will bring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today I’m proud to share that our next-generation console will be called PlayStation 5, and we’ll be launching in time for Holiday 2020.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a specific date, but it&rsquo;s effectively a promise that you&rsquo;ll be able to buy it in the run-up to Christmas 2020.</p>
<p>In reality, that probably means the new console going on sale in October or November.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great time for a new console to come out, as those months are when blockbuster releases like new Call of Duty games typically happen.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the likeliest date? Well the PS4 launched on November 15, 2013 – a Friday.</p>
<p>And the PS4 Pro launched on November 10, 2016 – a Thursday.</p>
<p>Based on those launches, we predict either a November 12 or 13 PS5 release date in 2020.</p>

<h3 id="who-is-nkosi-johnson-and-why-is-google-doodle-celebrating-him--the-sun">&ldquo;Who is Nkosi Johnson and why is Google Doodle celebrating him? – The Sun&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/goo.1200x800.jpg?strip=all&amp;quality=100&amp;w=1200&amp;h=800&amp;crop=1" alt="img">
TODAY&rsquo;S Google Doodle marks the impressive achievements of Nkosi Johnson, a boy who entranced a 10,000-strong audience revealing his life with &ldquo;full-blown Aids&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The South African activist was just 12 years old when he died, becoming the longest-surviving child born with HIV in the country at the time.</p>
<p>4 Today&rsquo;s Google Doodle celebrates South African lad, Nkosi Johnson Credit: Google</p>
<p>Who was Nkosi Johnson?</p>
<p>Nkosi Johnson was South Africa&rsquo;s famous child activist who courageously campaigned for the equal rights of kids with Aids.</p>
<p>He was born Xolani Nkosi in Johannesburg, South Africa, on Feb 4 in 1989 - and was HIV-positive.</p>
<p>His mum, Nonthlanthla Daphne Nkosi, was HIV-positive and passed the virus on to her unborn child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He became a statistic: one of more than 70 000 children born HIV-positive in South Africa every year,&rdquo; explains website Nkosi&rsquo;s Haven.</p>
<p>Google says that a public relations officer named Gail Johnson soon adopted Nkosi from an Aids care centre with his mum’s blessing. Daphne died of an Aids-related illness in 1997.</p>
<p>Together, Gail and Nkosi began their historic fight against the autoimmune disease.</p>

<p>Why is Google Doodle celebrating him?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Nkosi faced discrimination and rejection while trying to attend school.</p>
<p>As soon as his HIV status was known, teachers and parents opposed his presence.</p>
<p>Gail refused to accept him being stigmatised, and went public with a complaint.</p>
<p>She won, and Nkosi was able to start lessons.</p>

<p>The lad became a &ldquo;national figure in the campaign to de-stigmatise Aids, with provincial education departments across South Africa moving to draw up new policies&rdquo;, Nkosi&rsquo;s Haven explains.</p>
<p>His determined foster mother organised workshops that educated the South African community about AIDS.</p>
<p>Plus, her efforts prompted Parliament to pass legislation that required schools to uphold anti-discrimination policies that protected children like Nkosi.</p>

<p>And in July 2000, the boy addressed delegates at the 13th International Aids Conference in Durban on the autoimmune disease.</p>
<p>Aged just 11, he held an audience of 10,000 delegates in &ldquo;occasionally tearful silence as he told his story&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Brave Nkosi said: &ldquo;Care for us and accept us – we are all human beings.</p>
<p>“We are normal. We have hands. We have feet. We can walk, we can talk, we have needs just like everyone else. Don’t be afraid of us – we are all the same.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he died the following year, at the age of 12.</p>
<p>In honour of his bravery, the KidsRight organisation created the International Children’s Peace Prize in 2005.</p>
<p>Each year the award - a “Nkosi” statuette - is given to a young winner for promoting children’s rights.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, NGO Nkosi’s Haven continues to provides a safe home and healthcare for families affected by Aids.</p>

<p>In 1998, Google founders Larry and Sergey drew a stick figure behind the second &lsquo;o&rsquo; of Google to show they were out of office at the Burning Man festival and with that, Google Doodles were born.</p>
<p>The company decided that they should decorate the logo to mark cultural moments and it soon became clear that users really enjoyed the change to the Google homepage.</p>
<p>Now, there is a full team of doodlers, illustrators, graphic designers, animators and classically trained artists who help create what you see on those days.

<p><img src="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/750x445/1246731.jpg" alt="img">
Adding to the eyebrow-raising literature is a new study published in the journal Age and Ageing, which found a strong association between having a daily tipple and living to the age of 90.</p>
<p>The study found that men and women who enjoyed a daily drink were up to 40 per cent more likely to make it to their 90th birthday than those who were teetotal, or rarely indulged.</p>
<p>This is not a licence to drink with reckless abandon however. The benefits were only observed in those who stuck to one drink a day - binge drinkers died earlier.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the findings also differentiate between men and women, finding that drinking wine is most conducive to a long life for women and spirits like whisky, brandy or gin brought longevity benefits for men.</p>

FACEBOOK has started rolling out a brand new desktop redesign.</p>
<p>Plans for the new look were announced back in April last year and you may be surprised by the minimalism of the finished design.</p>
<p>1 The new layout will be available to all users in the coming weeks Credit: Facebook</p>
<p>Almost all of the website is now white, not blue, including the banner at the top.</p>
<p>This white banner holds light grey icons for News Feed, Facebook Messenger, notifications, Watch, Marketplace and Groups.</p>
<p>Facebook Stories has been moved to the certain of the page and you can see them in large rectangles rather than smaller circles.</p>
<p>The social network&rsquo;s logo has changed so it&rsquo;s now a white &lsquo;F&rsquo; in a bright blue circle rather than a square.</p>
<p>the new facebook layout is so ugly im in disbelief — ヽ且ﾉ (@sakata) February 13, 2020</p>
<p>The fresh redesign isn&rsquo;t proving very popular on Twitter though.</p>
<p>Several unimpressed Facebook users has voiced there concerns.</p>
<p>The new Facebook layout is weird as on dark mode&hellip; — Kristofor Lawson (@kristoforlawson) February 14, 2020</p>
<p>One tweeted: &ldquo;New Facebook desktop layout = GROSS!”</p>
<p>Another said: “The new facebook layout is so ugly I&rsquo;m in disbelief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new dark mode aspect has also divided users.</p>
<p>Some praised it whilst others were less impressed.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t already have the new layout then rest assured it should be rolling out to all users in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>What info does Facebook hold on you? All the data on your profile - name, age, marital status, where you went to work, and so on.</p>
<p>Your activity on the site - which posts you like, pages followed, photos shared.</p>
<p>Its tracker cookies (which most websites use) can even follow you around the internet, so Facebook can also get an idea of the types of websites you like to visit – to serve you more relevant advertisements.</p>
<p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the social media giant is reluctant to ban political ads because &lsquo;people should be able to judge for themselves&rsquo;</p>
